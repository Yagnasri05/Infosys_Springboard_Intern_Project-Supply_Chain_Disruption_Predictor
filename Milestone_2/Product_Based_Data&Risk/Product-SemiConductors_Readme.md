# Semiconductors:
Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy systems. Their production is concentrated in a few countries, making the supply chain highly susceptible to disruptions. Global events such as natural disasters, trade tensions, and pandemics have shown how a semiconductor shortage can lead to cascading effects across industries. 

# Exports & Imports in Semiconductor Supply Chains:
- The semiconductor supply chain is heavily reliant on a few key exporting and importing nations.
- Taiwan and South Korea dominate the manufacturing landscape, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone producing over 60% of the worldâ€™s semiconductors. South Korea, home to giants like Samsung and SK Hynix, specializes in memory chips.
- On the importing side, the United States is the largest consumer of semiconductors, primarily for its technology and automotive industries. The European Union also heavily relies on imports for automotive and industrial applications.
- This geographic concentration makes the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions like geopolitical tensions, such as US-China trade wars or the Taiwan-China conflict.

# Key Limitations of Semiconductor Supply Chains:
- The concentration of production in Asia creates a bottleneck; any disruption in this region can ripple globally. For example, earthquakes in Taiwan or political instability in South Korea can halt production. 
- The production of semiconductors is highly specialized, requiring state-of-the-art fabs that take years to build, making the supply chain slow to adapt to sudden demand spikes. 
- Transportation delays further exacerbate the problem due to the need for temperature-controlled and static-free environments.
