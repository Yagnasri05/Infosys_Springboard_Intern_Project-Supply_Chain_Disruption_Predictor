Dec 12, 2024 News

Kaieteur News- Global trade in wood and paper products dropped steeply from record levels in 2021 and 2022, with the paper trade continuing to decline under pressure from digital media, according to the latest data released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The Global forest products facts and figures 2023 report says the worldwide wood and paper products trade saw a significant drop of 12 percent: exports decreased by US$64 billion to US$482 billion in 2023.

This level was still above the highest international trade value ever seen before 2021. But significantly, the fact that trade value declined faster than traded quantities for most of the products indicates a drop in forest product prices in 2023 amid a general slowdown in economic growth. Global production of paper and paperboard contracted by 3 percent, owing to a continuous replacement of printed media with digital products.

""What we have seen happening is a combination of factors, with production and trade declining due to global supply chain disruption, slowing consumer demand and trade restrictions, together with a longer-term decline for example in global paper production and trade along with the progress of digitalization,"" said Zhimin Wu, Director of FAO's Forestry Division.

Most categories show decline

Global production and trade of most major wood-based products recorded a decline in 2023 with only wood-based panels recording a marginal growth in production.

Industrial roundwood (used for any purpose other than energy and includes pulpwood, sawlogs and veneer logs, and wood used for fence posts and telephone or electricity poles) - In 2023, global industrial roundwood removals declined by 4 percent to 1.92 billion m³. Global trade decreased by 13 percent to 100 million m³ (the lowest level since 2009).

Sawnwood (including planks, sleepers or cross-ties, beams, joists, boards, rafters and lumber) - Production decreased in all five regions around the world in 2023. Global production of sawnwood contracted by 4 percent to 445 million m³ (the lowest since 2014), and the decline in international trade was as twice a big - 8 percent to 129 million m³ (the lowest since 2014).

Wood-based panels (plywood including blockboard and laminated veneer lumber, particle board, oriented strand board, and fibreboard) - Global wood-based panel production grew by just 1 percent to 381 million m³ (owing to increased production in the Asia-Pacific that offset a decrease in other regions). However, international trade in wood-based panels followed a downward trend similar to that of other products, falling by 7 percent to 84 million m³ (lowest since 2016).

Wood pulp - Global production of wood pulp declined by 2 percent to reach 193 million tonnes. In contrast, trade in wood pulp increased by 3 percent to reach a record level of 71 million tonnes.

Paper and paperboard - In 2023, production declined in Europe and northern America, while it stagnated in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. It grew only in Asia-Pacific. World paper production dropped by 3 percent to 401 million tonnes (trade by 7 percent to 104 million tonnes, the lowest since 2010). Global production of graphic papers declined by 9 percent while other paper and paperboard recorded a smaller decrease of 3 percent in 2023. Production of graphic papers in 2023 (84 million tonnes) was at the lowest level since 1987.

Wood pellet - Production has increased dramatically in the last decades, mainly owing to demand generated from bioenergy targets set by countries. However, the growth for the first time paused in 2023, recording a drop in production by 2 percent and trade by 5 percent. In 2023, global production reached 47 million tonnes.

Engineered wood products - The first ever published data on engineered wood products launched by FAO show that in 2023 global production of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) amounted to 4 million m³ (exports - 1 million m³), glue-laminated timber (glulam) - 7 million m³ (exports - 2 million m³), cross-laminated timber (CLT or X-lam) - 1 million m³ (exports - 0.6 million m³) and I-beams (I-joists) - 1 million tonnes (exports - 0.3 million tonnes).

supply chain disruption,Ecological integrity vital to human rights debate - The Statesman,The Statesman,https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/ecological-integrity-vital-to-human-rights-debate-1503374990.html,"This year marks the 76th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a pivotal document that symbolizes humanity's enduring commitment to fundamental rights and freedoms.

This year marks the 76th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a pivotal document that symbolizes humanity's enduring commitment to fundamental rights and freedoms.

However, as we commemorate this milestone, it is crucial to engage in a critical introspection and stock-taking of its implications and effectiveness in addressing contemporary challenges ongoing war, geopolitical tension-led destruction and displacement, supply chain disruption posing severe challenges to energy and food security, not to speak of tremendous strain on an already under-resourced health system coupled with newer shockwaves under the guise of minority bashing, retreat of secular democracy and political instability around the world.

Also, what is crystal clear is the pervasive disappointment with the recently concluded COP29 outcomes that flaunt ambitious rhetoric while exposing shortfalls in addressing the spectre of an impending apocalypse. In this connection, the distinction between weak and strong versions of human rights becomes increasingly pertinent, particularly when considering how these rights are interpreted and implemented across different contexts.

While the UDHR sets forth cogent universal principles, the practical realities are conspicuous by the absence of any level playing field - especially in developing nations - that reveals a stark contrast between ideals and lived experiences. This dissonance raises significant surmises about the adequacy of the current framework regarding state capacity for protecting human dignity amidst escalating crises. This, however, does not mean the current crisis of human rights is confined to the developing world, which undoubtedly faces the brunt of structural exploitation, resource scarcity, and crippling debt exacerbated by neoliberal globalization.

Rather, the prevailing situation highlights a ubiquitous need to re-evaluate our understanding of human rights on a broader scale. The dilemma, however, emanates from the fact that the notion of visualising a level playing field among nations has become increasingly elusive. Despite the formal end of colonial conquests, which formally paved the way for equality among states, the prevailing legal frameworkswhat can be termed the ""Nomos of the earth""-continue to favour powerful nations, a straitjacket of offensive realism resonating over and above an alternative constructivist vision.

This systemic imbalance suggests that rather than moving towards a Kantian ideal of perpetual peace and cooperation, humanity remains trapped in an intensified vicious cycle of conflict and struggle. The implications are profound: they challenge us to reconsider not only how human rights are defined but also who gets to define them and therein lies the danger of bias and attenuation. The glimmer of hope, however, lies with the protracted struggle that underscores the necessity for a more inclusive and grounded dialogue about human rights with diversity of voices that transcends geographical peripheries and economic boundaries.

The traditional frameworks often reflect the interests of hegemonic powers, leaving marginalized voices unheard and perpetuating inequalities. As we confront these realities, it becomes evident that reimagining human rights as a monolithic category has become an extremely difficult project in the currently diverse perspectives and sort of self-centric subjectivity save and except a veneer of a ""certain dominant anthropology"" or ideology. It is a function of highly sophisticated power structures with their tentacles of governmentality plus modern life's increasing integration with the system at the global scale that inhibit true equality both within and without.

That's why, the concept of human rights received traction with the narrative requirement to put human beings at the centre of the story when in the guise of technology, politics or techno-politics has emerged as a fierce domain of muscle flexing to imperil the human condition. As Hannah Arendt in the preface to her major reflective work ""The Origins of Totalitarianism"" noted, ""We can no longer afford to take that which was good in the past and simply call it our heritage, to discard the bad and simply think of it as a dead load which by itself will bury in oblivion.""

Similarly, today, it seems that the notion of benign humanity is passé; we, much like robots, are senselessly moving towards an overly human-centric future that breeds overconfidence in our ability to manage and tame the lurking signs of environmental disaster. This trajectory fosters a dangerous illusion of resilience as if humanity can ensure smooth sailing through the tumultuous waters of the ecological crisis. In this context, we find ourselves ensnared in a web of spurious optimism, believing that technological breakthroughs and human ingenuity alone can vouchsafe our existence. Yet, even the insights offered by Michel Foucault in his theoretical formulation of biopolitics do not adequately measure up to address the larger existential question concerning the survival of our species.

As Professor Dipesh Chakrabarty aptly articulated, ""Humans are not central to the problem of habitability, but habitability is central to human existence."" This perspective challenges us to reconsider our place within a differently oriented genre of ecological framework and recognize that our survival is intricately linked to the health of the planet itself. Rather than viewing ourselves as masters of nature, we must acknowledge that our fate is intertwined with the very system we often take for granted. The urgency for a paradigm shift in how we perceive our relationship with the environment has never been more critical.

This situation appraises us of a new stage of ""unhappy consciousness"" that humanity must reckon with, as it highlights a profound dilemma at the intersection of human rights and environmental sustainability. At the centre of this dilemma lies the realization that while human rights, in their maximalist sense, advocate for an omnibus nature of entitlements and freedoms, they simultaneously pose significant threats to vital ecosystems such as forests and water bodies. This occurs under the guise of unbalanced growth, where unscrupulous pursuit of individual rights often overshadows collective and deeply empathetic responsibilities towards our planet.

Therefore, it is not sufficient merely to cultivate ""an ability to discern the vitality of the matter""; rather, it necessitates a theoretical maturity that transcends the presentism inherent in the vice of indulgent consumerism. Humanity must embrace a more holistic planetary perspective that prioritizes the sentient wisdom for course correction over short-term gains. This shift requires a prodigious acknowledgement that true progress cannot be measured solely by economic rights or personal freedoms but must also account for ecological integrity and intergenerational equity.

supply chain disruption,"Gas, power tariff hikes under IMF fuel inflation: finance minister",Dawn,https://www.dawn.com/news/1878236,"* Gas prices rose 840pc, electricity by 110pc; rupee fell 43pc since 2019

* Sugar, wheat, palm oil, crude oil prices also saw major increases

ISLAMABAD: The government admitted on Wednesday that a record 840 per cent increase in gas prices, over 110pc rise in electricity tariffs and a 43pc currency depreciation under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme have contributed significantly to the unprecedented inflation that has eroded the purchasing power and living standards of many Pakistanis.

""Under the IMF stabilisation programme, the government has increased the long-due utility prices (electricity and gas),"" Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in a written testimony before the National Assembly on Wednesday.

Giving details in response to a question from another government parliamentarian, Tahira Aurangzeb, the minister said that from November 2023 to February 2024, a major increase in gas and electricity charges had been observed.

Gas tariff rose by 520pc in November 2023 (index increased from 217 to 1,344) and by an additional 319pc in February 2024 (index from 353 to 1,479). Similarly, electricity charges increased by 35pc in November 2023 and another 75pc in February 2024.

Mr Aurangzeb noted that ""the unprecedented increase in the price of these items ultimately jacked up the overall inflation in FY2024"".

The finance minister also put on record that inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 8.9pc and 12.2pc in FY21 and FY22, respectively. He also conceded that the increase in CPI more than doubled to 29.2pc in FY23, before declining to 23.4pc in FY24. The inflation in the first five months (July-November) of the current year plunged to 7.9pc, he said.

He said the currency depreciation intensified the inflationary problem, as the exchange rate depreciated by 43.2pc to Rs278.4 per dollar in June 2024 from Rs158.8 per dollar in July 2019.

The minister also counted other reasons for the increase in inflation rates, including a 54pc increase in sugar prices, from $280 per tonne in July 2019 to $430 in June 2024.

Palm oil prices also increased by 61pc during the same period, from $544 to $874 per tonne, while soya bean oil prices went up by 35pc to $1,011 per tonne from $748.

During the same period, wheat prices jumped by 35pc to $265 per tonne from $196.2 while crude oil prices increased by 29pc to $82.6 per tonne.

On top of that, the 2022 floods caused significant damage to the economy, especially the agriculture sector. About 4.5 million acres of crops were damaged, and around one million animals were lost. Total damages and losses amounted to $30.13 billion, of which agriculture suffered $12.9bn (43pc of total damages and losses).

The crop sub-sector contributed to 82pc of the total damage and losses, livestock to 7pc, and fisheries/aquaculture to 1pc. Due to crop damage and supply chain disruption, food inflation surged to 38pc while headline inflation increased by 29.2pc in FY2023.

To control the inflationary pressure, the minister said the Competition Commission was taking measures to control cartelisation and undue profiteering, but he did not mention those measures that could have been noticed by the citizens.

However, he also counted strict action against illegal foreign exchange companies, smuggling, and hoarding in the commodity market, which helped achieve exchange rate stability, market confidence, and a smooth supply of commodities.

The minister said that reductions in energy prices, such as a decline in electricity charges, alongside falling motor fuel prices, significantly eased inflationary pressures on the public and increased allocations of BISP welfare schemes supported the vulnerable.

supply chain disruption,OMB Seeks Info on Domestic Chip Manufacture Procurement Approaches,Executive Gov,https://executivegov.com/2024/12/omb-rfi-procurement-domestic-chip-manufacturing/,"The Office of Management and Budget has started soliciting input on methods the federal government can implement to strengthen the resilience of domestic semiconductor manufacturing and maintain this capability through the acquisition of commercial IT end products, including chips produced in the U.S.

OMB said Tuesday that through the request for information, the current administration intends to understand how the federal acquisition system can best leverage domestic chip sources to ensure a secure supply chain for commercial IT products and services purchased by the U.S. government.

The agency is soliciting feedback on potential procurement approaches to mitigate supply chain disruption and increase chip production in the U.S.

The government seeks to determine ways to incentivize government contractors to scale up their use of semiconductors produced in the U.S.

According to the RFI, market segments of interest include telecommunication infrastructure and services, cloud and data center infrastructure and services, transportation and vehicles, and ICT devices such as mobile phones and laptops.

OMB is asking stakeholders how quickly they could start using domestically produced semiconductors given the existence of sufficient economic incentives and how much production is needed to constitute a sufficient domestic chip supply.

The RFI also includes questions pertaining to domestic supply chain vulnerabilities surrounding semiconductors, the anticipated timeline for domestic production, factors that cause significant delays in bringing domestic manufacturing facilities online and the types of innovations that could help improve the efficiency of the manufacturing market.

The agency also asked about actions the federal government should take to promote strong small business participation by resellers offering commercial IT with domestically produced semiconductors.

According to OMB, the RFI follows a series of measures the government has initiated to enable an essential supply of domestically fabricated semiconductors.

Such actions include the Department of Commerce's CHIPS Incentives Program, the Department of Defense's Microelectronics Commons initiative and the Tech Hubs program.",,,,N/A,N/A,U.S.
supply chain disruption,Navigating the Impact of China's Export Restrictions on Critical Materials · EMSNow,EMSNow,https://www.emsnow.com/navigating-the-impact-of-chinas-export-restrictions-on-critical-materials/,"Recent developments in the global electronics industry have raised concerns about the availability of critical materials. China's decision to restrict the export of gallium, germanium, and antimony in response to tightened U.S. sanctions on semiconductor technology has significant implications for manufacturers worldwide. These materials are vital for producing semiconductors, LEDs, fiber optics, and other high-tech components that power modern electronics.

SOURCE: White Horse Laboratories

supply chain disruption,Mercury Introduces Digital Signal Processing Products Powered by Altera's Newest Agilex™ 9 FPGAs,IT News Online,https://www.itnewsonline.com/GlobeNewswire/Mercury-Introduces-Digital-Signal-Processing-Products-Powered-by-Alteras-Newest-Agilex-9-FPGAs/89595,"ANDOVER, Mass., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), a technology company that delivers mission-critical processing power to the edge, today introduced a system-on-module (SOM) and 3U SOSA-aligned OpenVPX board powered by Altera's™ most advanced Agilex 9 Direct RF FPGA chips.

The DRF2270 SOM and DRF5270 3U board are the latest additions to Mercury's portfolio of Direct RF digital signal processing products that use Altera FPGAs to detect and process information from a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These commercially available products directly digitize radio frequency signals at the antenna, eliminating the analog signal down conversion stages required by legacy hardware. This approach requires extremely fast converters, high-bandwidth digital data links, and powerful real-time digital signal processing. The results are reductions in size, weight, power, cost, and latency that can benefit a variety of radar, communications, electronic warfare, SIGINT, and industrial applications.

Mercury's DRF2270 is an 8-channel SOM that converts between analog and digital signals at 64 gigasamples per second. It features Altera's latest-generation Agilex 9 AGRW027 FPGA, which delivers enhanced performance with double the number of channel converters, 47% more logic elements, and 34% more memory than the previous generation chip. The DRF5270 board incorporates the DRF2270 SOM into a defense-ready 3U form factor with 10, 40, and 100 GigE optical interfaces. The flexible SOM design allows the DRF5270 to be easily customized to specific applications without requiring the board to be redesigned from scratch. The DRF2270 SOM can also be packaged into other small form factor and customized designs.

Mercury continues to offer the DRF2580 SOM based on the earlier Agilex 9 AGRW014 FPGA, and the DRF4580L, a small-form-factor module that incorporates the DRF2580 within a ruggedized, conduction-cooled enclosure that is ready for defense applications. All of Mercury's Direct RF products come with the Navigator Board Support Package and FPGA Design Kit that allow customers to develop custom IP for the module that can be installed within hours.

""The Mercury Processing Platform brings advanced commercial technologies to defense missions, allowing customers to save time and cost by deploying easily customized hardware that leverages the same core technology and IP across different programs,"" said Ken Hermanny, Mercury's Vice President of Signal Technologies. ""With a growing portfolio of products that make Direct RF spectrum digitization possible, our customers now have more options to deploy this technology to capture, process, and exploit signals at the edge.""

""Altera's Agilex™ 9 Wideband Direct RF FPGAs integrate either four or eight 64 Gsps ADC/DAC data converter pairs in the package with FPGA resources that provide real-time processing of up to an unprecedented 32 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth,"" said Ben Esposito, Senior Principal Engineer, Military, Aerospace, and Government Business Unit at Altera. ""By integrating circuitry that used to be done in the analog domain, these devices address size, weight, and power challenges of next-generation aerospace and defense missions. Our partnership with Mercury brings this cutting-edge RF technology to military customers, enabling rapid deployment via the different wideband platforms Mercury has developed.""

The DRF2270 and DRF5270 feature:

Mercury will be showcasing the DRF2270 and DRF5270 at booth 616 at the AOC International Symposium and Convention in National Harbor, MD, December 11-13, 2024.

ANDOVER, Mass., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), a technology company that delivers mission-critical processing power to the edge, today introduced a system-on-module (SOM) and 3U SOSA-aligned OpenVPX board powered by Altera's™ most advanced Agilex 9 Direct RF FPGA chips.

The DRF2270 SOM and DRF5270 3U board are the latest additions to Mercury's portfolio of Direct RF digital signal processing products that use Altera FPGAs to detect and process information from a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These commercially available products directly digitize radio frequency signals at the antenna, eliminating the analog signal down conversion stages required by legacy hardware. This approach requires extremely fast converters, high-bandwidth digital data links, and powerful real-time digital signal processing. The results are reductions in size, weight, power, cost, and latency that can benefit a variety of radar, communications, electronic warfare, SIGINT, and industrial applications.

Mercury's DRF2270 is an 8-channel SOM that converts between analog and digital signals at 64 gigasamples per second. It features Altera's latest-generation Agilex 9 AGRW027 FPGA, which delivers enhanced performance with double the number of channel converters, 47% more logic elements, and 34% more memory than the previous generation chip. The DRF5270 board incorporates the DRF2270 SOM into a defense-ready 3U form factor with 10, 40, and 100 GigE optical interfaces. The flexible SOM design allows the DRF5270 to be easily customized to specific applications without requiring the board to be redesigned from scratch. The DRF2270 SOM can also be packaged into other small form factor and customized designs.

Mercury continues to offer the DRF2580 SOM based on the earlier Agilex 9 AGRW014 FPGA, and the DRF4580L, a small-form-factor module that incorporates the DRF2580 within a ruggedized, conduction-cooled enclosure that is ready for defense applications. All of Mercury's Direct RF products come with the Navigator® Board Support Package and FPGA Design Kit that allow customers to develop custom IP for the module that can be installed within hours.

""The Mercury Processing Platform brings advanced commercial technologies to defense missions, allowing customers to save time and cost by deploying easily customized hardware that leverages the same core technology and IP across different programs,"" said Ken Hermanny, Mercury's Vice President of Signal Technologies. ""With a growing portfolio of products that make Direct RF spectrum digitization possible, our customers now have more options to deploy this technology to capture, process, and exploit signals at the edge.""

""Altera's Agilex™ 9 Wideband Direct RF FPGAs integrate either four or eight 64 Gsps ADC/DAC data converter pairs in the package with FPGA resources that provide real-time processing of up to an unprecedented 32 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth,"" said Ben Esposito, Senior Principal Engineer, Military, Aerospace, and Government Business Unit at Altera. ""By integrating circuitry that used to be done in the analog domain, these devices address size, weight, and power challenges of next-generation aerospace and defense missions. Our partnership with Mercury brings this cutting-edge RF technology to military customers, enabling rapid deployment via the different wideband platforms Mercury has developed.""

supply chain disruption,ITS Logistics December Port Rail Ramp Index: US West Coast Ports Experience Significant Import Volumes Amid Fears of January ILA Strike,IT News Online,https://www.itnewsonline.com/GlobeNewswire/ITS-Logistics-December-Port-Rail-Ramp-Index-US-West-Coast-Ports-Experience-Significant-Import-Volumes-Amid-Fears-of-January-ILA-Strike/89590,"-- ITS Logistics confirms East and Gulf Coast ports are experiencing normal calm post retail peak and prior to Lunar New Year --

RENO, Nev., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ITS Logistics today released the December forecast for the ITS Logistics US Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index. This month, the index confirms that at a macro level, there have been no major changes since November's index. The East and Gulf ports are seeing the normal December calm post retail peak and prior to the Lunar New Year. Surprisingly, the US West Coast ports are still experiencing significant import volumes, which may result from some inventory being pulled forward to avoid possible tariffs and the expected International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) strike activity in January. The potential strike activity that could take place in combination with a Lunar New Year volume spike is something ITS is keeping a close eye on, as both are set to occur fairly close together on the calendar.

""The volumes coming from Asia on the trans-Pacific trade routes are not overwhelming the supply of capacity as spot rates at origin are not being pushed higher,"" said Paul Brashier, Vice President of Global Supply Chain for ITS Logistics. ""For the time being, everything seems balanced. That said, if the US West Coast continues to be a release valve for a potential ILA strike supply chain disruption, there is a high risk that both West Coast Port and Rail operations could become overwhelmed.""

According to Drewry's World Container Index (WCI), spot rates on the Shanghai-New York leg were down 3% week on week, to $5,761 per 40ft, but Shanghai-Los Angeles was down 5% week on week to $5,071 per 40ft. The Xeneta XSI transpacific route also declined 2.5% to $5,489 per 40ft. Overall, the total October containerized imports volume across US ports amounted to 2.25 million twenty-foot equivalent units through ports covered by the Global Port Tracker, which was off by 1.2% from September but ahead 9.3% from October of last year. Ports have not yet reported November's numbers, but Global Port Tracker projected the month at 2.17 million TEU, up 14.4% year over year.

Earlier this month, the ILA warned that another coastwide strike could occur when management from the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) confirmed their intent to implement semi-automation. This directly contradicted the USMX opening statement, assuring the ILA that neither full nor semi-automation would be an option moving forward. Although both sides agreed to extend the current contract until January 15, 2025, as of last week, neither party has chosen to pursue a new stance on implementing semi-automated rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGs).

""While the industry awaits the latest update pertaining to the strike, professionals must also be aware that rail operations in Seattle and Los Angeles are continuing to struggle with interior point intermodal (IPI) freight and higher volumes of domestic peak retail freight,"" continued Brashier. ""Due to many shippers avoiding IPI legs and rail service for domestic goods, we are starting to see considerable capacity strain and upward rate pressure for lanes moving West-East on over the road capacity.""

Just last month, it was reported that rail dwell times at the Port of Long Beach were at about four days as of Nov. 12, according to the port's operations dashboard. The Port of Los Angeles' on-dock average rail dwell times were close to eight days as of Nov. 13, as noted in the port's operations report.

ITS Logistics offers a full suite of network transportation solutions across North America and distribution and fulfillment services to 95% of the U.S. population within two days. These services include drayage and intermodal in 22 coastal ports and 30 rail ramps, a full suite of asset and asset-lite transportation solutions, omnichannel distribution and fulfillment, LTL, and outbound small parcel.

The ITS Logistics US Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index forecasts port container and dray operations for the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf regions. Ocean and domestic container rail ramp operations are also highlighted in the index for both the West Inland and East Inland regions. Visit here for a full comprehensive copy of the index with expected forecasts for the US port and rail ramps.

supply chain disruption,ITS Logistics December Port Rail Ramp Index: US West Coast Ports Experience Significant Import Volumes Amid Fears of January ILA Strike,Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/12/g42442297/its-logistics-december-port-rail-ramp-index-us-west-coast-ports-experience-significant-import-volu,"RENO, Nev., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ITS Logistics today released the December forecast for the ITS Logistics US Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index. This month, the index confirms that at a macro level, there have been no major changes since November's index. The East and Gulf ports are seeing the normal December calm post retail peak and prior to the Lunar New Year. Surprisingly, the US West Coast ports are still experiencing significant import volumes, which may result from some inventory being pulled forward to avoid possible tariffs and the expected International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) strike activity in January. The potential strike activity that could take place in combination with a Lunar New Year volume spike is something ITS is keeping a close eye on, as both are set to occur fairly close together on the calendar.

""The volumes coming from Asia on the trans-Pacific trade routes are not overwhelming the supply of capacity as spot rates at origin are not being pushed higher,"" said Paul Brashier, Vice President of Global Supply Chain for ITS Logistics. ""For the time being, everything seems balanced. That said, if the US West Coast continues to be a release valve for a potential ILA strike supply chain disruption, there is a high risk that both West Coast Port and Rail operations could become overwhelmed.""

According to Drewry's World Container Index (WCI), spot rates on the Shanghai-New York leg were down 3% week on week, to $5,761 per 40ft, but Shanghai-Los Angeles was down 5% week on week to $5,071 per 40ft. The Xeneta XSI transpacific route also declined 2.5% to $5,489 per 40ft. Overall, the total October containerized imports volume across US ports amounted to 2.25 million twenty-foot equivalent units through ports covered by the Global Port Tracker, which was off by 1.2% from September but ahead 9.3% from October of last year. Ports have not yet reported November's numbers, but Global Port Tracker projected the month at 2.17 million TEU, up 14.4% year over year.

Earlier this month, the ILA warned that another coastwide strike could occur when management from the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) confirmed their intent to implement semi-automation. This directly contradicted the USMX opening statement, assuring the ILA that neither full nor semi-automation would be an option moving forward. Although both sides agreed to extend the current contract until January 15, 2025, as of last week, neither party has chosen to pursue a new stance on implementing semi-automated rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGs).

""While the industry awaits the latest update pertaining to the strike, professionals must also be aware that rail operations in Seattle and Los Angeles are continuing to struggle with interior point intermodal (IPI) freight and higher volumes of domestic peak retail freight,"" continued Brashier. ""Due to many shippers avoiding IPI legs and rail service for domestic goods, we are starting to see considerable capacity strain and upward rate pressure for lanes moving West-East on over the road capacity.""

Just last month, it was reported that rail dwell times at the Port of Long Beach were at about four days as of Nov. 12, according to the port's operations dashboard. The Port of Los Angeles' on-dock average rail dwell times were close to eight days as of Nov. 13, as noted in the port's operations report.

ITS Logistics offers a full suite of network transportation solutions across North America and distribution and fulfillment services to 95% of the U.S. population within two days. These services include drayage and intermodal in 22 coastal ports and 30 rail ramps, a full suite of asset and asset-lite transportation solutions, omnichannel distribution and fulfillment, LTL, and outbound small parcel.

supply chain disruption,Experts call for a shift from reactive to proactive clinical trial supply frameworks,Yahoo!

Prioritising supply chains in clinical trial design was a key topic of discussion at the 2024 Outsourcing in Clinical Trials and Clinical Trial Supply East Asia conferences, held in Seoul, South Korea, from 3 to 4 December.

Supply chains are too often a ""last cog""

A report by GlobalData demonstrates that supply chain disruptions have become worse and more frequent over the past decade. Reworking supply chains is complex and expensive, with no quick fixes. Instances where the chain cannot keep up with demand can create medicine shortages, seen most recently in the pharmaceutical industry with popular weight loss drug Wegovy (semaglutide).

Fiona Barry, editor-in-chief and director of PharmaSource, GlobalData, outlined in a session the key challenges to supply chains. Increased demand and shortage of active ingredients contributed the biggest share for current drug shortages in the US, according to her analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Shortages database.

Panellists at the conference highlighted that supply chain logistics is often the ""last cog"" to be implanted and often the forgotten area of clinical research. Because supply chains are not involved in strategic decisions, this can create constraints throughout protocols and manufacturing strategy. Emphasising supply chains earlier on in the clinical research journey could create trials that are more robust to disruptions.

For example, Amaury Jeandrain, clinical supply strategy adviser at N-Side, said: ""If supply chain could influence protocol design, we could have protocols that are supply chain friendly.""

Jeandrain explained that reducing drug waste can have a strong impact on supply chain costs, mediated via supply chain-friendly protocols.

Hye Jung Yang, panellist and clinical project manager at MedPacto, echoed the preventative standpoint, explaining that mitigating risk should be conducted before the trial has commenced. She added that using data to predict issues is much easier than reacting to them once they occur.

Geopolitical uncertainty

An area that might be harder to predict, however, is unforeseeable disruptions. Geopolitical issues are a key source of supply chain disruption, according to analysis by GlobalData. These scenarios, along with problems such as quality issues or compotator shortages, are nearly impossible to predict. Hurricane Helene, for example, created significant shortages in intravenous (IV) fluid bags on the US East Coast due to facility floodings in October - this delayed several clinical trials in the area. In addition, discussions are ongoing about the potential disruption to R&D and manufacturing from the BIOSECURE Act - legislation aimed at preventing Chinese biotechs and manufacturers from accessing and collaborating with US pharma companies using federal funding.",,,,N/A,N/A,"South Korea, IV, Seoul, US"
supply chain disruption,Paul Krugman's Final Piece in the NY Times: a Flawed Critique of the Status Quo,La Voce di New York,https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/12/11/paul-krugmans-final-piece-in-the-ny-times-a-flawed-critique-of-the-status-quo/,"Economist Paul Krugman has published his final opinion piece in the New York Times after offering his economic insights and expertise for nearly 25 years. His message of farewell as he looks back over his career at the Gray Lady is an attempt to make sense of the widely-shared optimism at the turn of the century that has given way to the ""anger and resentment"" of today. It is a tall order to collapse a quarter century's worth of political developments into a few hundred words, but Krugman gets his point across with a well-crafted synthesis that comes with cranking out pieces over the same length of time.

At the turn of the 21 century, people were happier, according to Krugman, who cites opinion polls finding that in the US as well as Europe, most people thought that things were looking up - so what happened? He claims that the fundamental difference between then and now is that we have suffered a ""collapse of trust in elites."" Smoking guns include the 2008 financial crisis in the United States, and the European crisis which reached its nadir in 2012. In each case, the general public lost ""any faith the public had that governments knew how to manage economies,"" and Krugman also points to associated industries like banking and big tech, which have also seen faith in their stewardship fall. (While we're on the subject of elite institutions failing the general public, Krugman might have also cited the opioid epidemic, an entirely avoidable public health crisis that was caused by too little regulation of, and too much faith in, pharmaceutical companies.)

Krugman goes on to detail how the officers in the upper echelons of those financial institutions, despite causing the '08 crisis with their ""wheeling and dealing,"" turned resentful as well, with their so-called ""Obama rage"" as they clutched their pearls at being called ""fat cats"" by the 44 president. Krugman incisively points out that besides the tongue-lashings, they've been doing (more than) fine, and their prickliness on this issue is simply ""the pettiness of plutocrats who used to bask in public approval and are now discovering that all the money in the world can't buy you love.""

Well said, Paul.

It would have been nice to see such gumption towards the elite classes of society and their failures over the past generation at particular hinge points when it would have moved public opinion towards real change. In 2016, Krugman was not calling out the ""wheeling and dealing"" of financial institutions, but instead tut-tutting then-candidate Bernie Sanders for his ambitious plans to reform the sector, saying that his ""pounding the table about big banks misses the point."" With our country's mega-banks bigger and more consolidated than before, priming us for an even worse crisis followed by a bailout like in '08, I'm all ears as to what the point actually is.

As a consolidated corporate sector raked in record profits after COVID by raising prices just because they could (studies estimate that this sellers' inflation accounts for about half of post-COVID price hikes), Krugman had little to say against them. He did, however, have some choice words for fellow economist Isabella Weber, who argued for price controls as a potential solution, calling her idea ""truly stupid"" on Twitter. (So much for decorum toward a colleague in one's field.) As inflation remained stubbornly high after its root causes - COVID-related supply-chain disruption and government spending, and a tight labor market - dissipated, and Weber's thesis gained traction, Krugman deleted the tweet and sheepishly apologized.

It is in this sense that Krugman is the best face for the Times on economic issues, as he has displayed a sharp critique of the status quo in retrospect, yet has mostly been its defender in the present moment. His limitations are those of the Times and the liberal class writ large, whose failure to call out the chicanery of the few against the many, or to support serious alternatives, has left room for malefactors like Trump to fill the gap with fatuous and dangerous promises. Here's hoping he finds an edge in his future endeavors.",,,,N/A,N/A,"the United States, US"
supply chain disruption,Opinion: Recent labour disputes show how transportation CEOs force Ottawa's hand,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-recent-labour-disputes-show-how-transportation-ceos-force-ottawas-hand/,"François Laporte is the national president of Teamsters Canada. Paul Boucher is the president of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference.

In recent weeks, corporate leaders have claimed that Canada is in the throes of a crisis of ""labour disruptions,"" citing examples from ports, airlines, railways and, most recently, Canada Post.

But underpinning those disruptions is a troubling trend.

The transportation industry's most powerful chief executives have developed a way to sidestep union negotiations. Here's their playbook, as we see it: Make unreasonable demands, accuse unions of being unreasonable for refusing to accept them, instigate job action, lock workers out to disrupt supply chains, and use the resulting outcry to press Ottawa to impose binding arbitration. We believe this to be bad faith bargaining.

In other words, large corporations have weaponized lockouts - not to press workers, but to strong-arm politicians. It's a tactic we've seen unfold five times this year alone, at WestJet, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. (CPKC) CP-T, Canadian National Railway Co. CNR-T and the ports of Montreal and Vancouver.

Take negotiations at CN, for example. The company put forward a series of unreasonable demands, including the power to forcibly relocate workers across the country for months at a time - uprooting families to address labour shortages in remote areas where CN had failed to hire and retain sufficient staff. We opposed these demands and others, only to be accused by CN of lacking the ""desire to reach a deal."" The company then locked us out in August, disrupting supply chains. They had been publicly asking for binding arbitration since June.

Federal politicians, despite their rhetoric about protecting workers' rights, routinely buckle under the pressure from companies. At the first sign of disruption, politicians abandon their supposed progressive principles and accept the false narrative that Canada's economy teeters on the brink of collapse the minute the ports or trains aren't quite running on time.

This argument is overly alarmist and fundamentally flawed. Canada is a strong country, with an economy far more resilient than these corporate narratives suggest. History shows Canada has withstood weeks-long strikes, without significant impacts on store shelves. Tribunals have even ruled that rail and port workers do not qualify as ""essential service"" employees. Unlike nurses or firefighters, nobody is going to die if transportation workers are on a picket line.

People forget that workers have a constitutional right to engage in collective bargaining. By repeatedly forcing unions into binding arbitration rather than forcing corporations to bargain in good faith, Ottawa is treading in dangerous legal waters. Our union and others have already filed court challenges and we're prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court.

Labour disputes, while inconvenient, have been an essential part of securing fair treatment for workers. In an era of soaring corporate profits and stagnant wages, strengthening collective bargaining has never been more urgent.

Work stoppages are exceedingly rare in Canada's federally-regulated private sector, with usually more than 93 per cent of collective agreements being negotiated without disruptions.

Labour disputes will come about from time to time in a free and democratic country. They should be expected and managed accordingly. Unlike other types of disruptions, they at least ensure working conditions are kept fair and decent, leading to social and economic benefits for all Canadians. In the long run, these benefits far outweigh their cost.

Luckily, large corporations already have all the tools they need to avoid labour disputes: Simply address workers' concerns and offer fair wages. This should be achievable for companies like CPKC, which paid its CEO Keith Creel more than $20-million last year - close to 160 times the company's median salary.

Mr. Creel has been among the loudest voices demanding government intervention to prevent workers from exercising their right to bargain. But his stated concern for Canada's economy and trading reputation deserves closer scrutiny.

During the last round of bargaining, CPKC demanded pay cuts and the rollback of safety protections - demands we firmly opposed.

On Aug. 9, in response to our refusal to accept an agreement detrimental to workers' interests, CPKC issued a lockout notice. Adding to this, under a little-known provision of the Canada Labour Code, the company threatened to change the terms of our collective agreement and suspend our grievance procedure, rendering the entire contract de facto unenforceable.

To safeguard our members' rights, we had no choice but to issue a strike notice. Contrary to Mr. Creel's public claims, however, this strike notice came nine days later, on Aug. 18 - after the lockout notice and threats to gut the agreement.

By making unreasonable demands at the bargaining table, threatening to dismantle our collective agreement, and ultimately locking out his own employees, what did Mr. Creel expect, if not a supply chain disruption?

Bosses hate the spotlight collective bargaining shines on their shoddy safety records, their payouts to executives and shareholders and the accountability negotiations demand.

Ultimately, it's the workers who operate the trains, fix the planes and deliver the goods. Listening to corporate voices over these workers is indefensible.

It's time for the government to stop caving to corporate pressure. Instead, it must stand with workers, enforce good-faith bargaining and uphold fairness and democracy.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Montreal, Ottawa, Canada, Vancouver"

I'd now ask you to turn to slide 6 of our presentation as I turn the call over to Sandy.

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

As we shared in our release, we delivered a solid start to fiscal 2025, which included revenue growth of over 4%, primarily resulting from positive volume growth in our wholesale business and improving adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, driven by actions to enhance our capabilities and drive efficiencies across the business. This performance led us to raise our full year outlook for all financial metrics other than capital spending.

Based on the progress updates I'll share momentarily, we also remain confident in our strategy and multi-year plan and our ability to deliver the financial objectives outlined in our October call, which we believe will lead to sustainable shareholder value creation. Now I'll go into more detail on the progress we made in the quarter, how it's helping the customer experience, and how we're working to become a more efficient partner and value creator for our suppliers and customers.

As we discussed on recent calls, we believe UNFI's scale; heritage; and natural, organic, and specialty products; and our expanding value-added services offering makes us uniquely suited to help retailers differentiate and compete in a highly dynamic and competitive environment. We can see these points of differentiation supporting many of our customers as they successfully execute their strategies in the marketplace.

In the quarter, our customer base contributed to volume growth above the gains reported by Nielsen for the supermarket space and helped strengthen our top line performance and expected trajectory. Volume gains in the quarter were about 2% compared to the prior year, and we've seen this positive trend continue into Q2.

Importantly, this performance indicates a solid start to the execution of our strategy, but it also demonstrates strong strategic execution by our over 30,000 store customer base, as we continue to sharpen our focus on providing differentiated products, programs, services and insights that help them compete effectively. To help extend this performance, we remain focused on strengthening service levels, simplicity, and transparency to our customers and suppliers while increasing efficiency across the business.

We know how important it is to deliver on time and full in the important holiday selling season and the whole company is focused on it. We also continue to roll out our revamped go-to-market program for suppliers, which aims to streamline and simplify their experience and help them accelerate their growth within our diverse retailer network.

Several of our large suppliers that have embraced the program have experienced volume gains that surpass their peer group as they've taken advantage of the data and insights we provide in areas such as new item placement or bringing items discontinued during COVID back on to customer sales.

We continue to focus on bringing additional suppliers into the program while making sure participants of all sizes have the best experience possible and are able to maximize the value and the growth opportunities that UNFI is making available to them. We will continue to execute our plan to pursue innovation in our offerings, optimize efficiency and strengthen service levels to help drive even greater value and trust with retailers as well as suppliers.

As we focus on becoming more efficient, Matteo's leadership has played a significant role in our progress. He has deep experience in helping turn around and improve businesses, largely through the disciplined implementation and rigorous follow-through of Lean Six Sigma management principles. This is already benefiting UNFI and our financial and operating performance.

I'll let him provide more color and details momentarily, but let me talk at a high level about a few of the actions that we've taken to improve the overall customer and supplier experience while removing cost and streamlining the organization. Reducing or eliminating waste is a big part of what we're trying to accomplish over the next three fiscal years.

With shrink reduction a big focus over the past five quarters, we brought shrink in line with historic pre-COVID levels, and we're now working to reduce it further, while simultaneously striving to increase the capacity of our network through ensuring that we have the right assortment, which should help drive higher sales for us and for our customers.

Decentralizing responsibility and accountability in the organization is another principle of Lean, as is the mutual development of key performance indicators that get measured and course corrected in near real time. As Matteo described on our last call, we've begun the process of pushing the Lean framework into our distribution centers, where local operators are involved in the process of creating and taking ownership of operational KPIs.

These same associates are at the center of problem-solving and creating action plans where performance is not meeting expectations. We piloted the process in two distribution centers and are pleased with the initial results.

Next, we'll begin further aligning our organization to deploy this methodology across more of our facilities. Our continued focus on network optimization has also proceeded as planned, and we have completed the closure of both our Billings and Bismarck conventional distribution centers, which we described last quarter.

We have retained the vast majority of the business from these DCs, which is now being serviced from nearby, more modern UNFI facilities with larger assortments. We are now marketing the real estate.

For similar reasons, we made the decision to close our Fort Wayne, Indiana distribution center and transfer that volume to neighboring facilities in Pennsylvania and Illinois, where we expect customers to see assortment and service level benefits. Associates and customers were informed of this in mid-November, and we expect to complete this move early in calendar 2025.

Fort Wayne is another owned DC, which will begin marketing at the appropriate time. We will continue to evaluate other similar optimization opportunities.

During the quarter, we also moved natural volumes from our York DC into our 50% larger, soon-to-be-automated Manchester DC, which we expect will yield service quality and efficiency benefits for our customers, suppliers and UNFI in the region. We can see the combination of adding value for customers and suppliers to support their sales alongside our efficiency focus, delivering tangible operating and financial improvement.

As we have combined above market sales volume with our improving efficiency, we've been able to increase net sales per employee by over 6% compared to the prior period, which is structurally improving profitability and free cash flow generation.

This is partially a result of growing sales driven by the success of our customer base and expanding customer relationships as well as our actions to enhance the responsiveness of our organization and empowering associates deeper in the organization to make real-time improvements.

All in, we drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 15% compared to the prior year first quarter and delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of sequentially improving adjusted EBITDA dollars. This progress reflects strong execution against our targets, and we will remain focused on executing at higher levels to continue to improve service levels, efficiency and free cash flow while reducing leverage.

As we execute, we become even more confident in our multiyear objectives, long-term trajectory and in our ability to add value for retailers and suppliers across the food retail ecosystem. We are focused on becoming the most efficient, value-creating long-term partner for our stakeholders, which in turn creates more opportunities for the approximately 28,000 UNFI associates who serve our customers with dedication every day. Together, we remain confident our plan will drive sustainable shareholder returns.

With that, let me turn it over to Matteo to discuss our Q1 results, Lean progress and revised outlook. Matteo?

Giorgio Tarditi

Thank you, Sandy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call.

As Sandy stated, we're off to a solid start in fiscal 2025 and remain confident in our multiyear strategy and the corresponding long-term financial objectives we outlined during our year-end call. Today I will provide additional insight into our first quarter results, including our free cash flow and capital structure, offer some early proof points around the initial success we've had with Lean principles and comment on our updated outlook for fiscal 2025.

With that, let's dive into our Q1 results. Turning to slide 8. Our first quarter sales came in at $7.9 billion, 4.2% higher than last year's first quarter. In wholesale, volumes were up nearly 2%, which represented another quarter of sequential acceleration and continuation of the trends we experienced as we exited fiscal 2024.

These volume increases reflected continued improvement across natural and conventional, with our natural business, again, seeing significantly stronger trends compared to the overall industry as well as expanded relationships with new and existing customers. Inflation was largely unchanged sequentially at about 1%, and down approximately 2 percentage points compared to the prior year quarter.

Total retail sales fell 3% year over year with ID sales down 1.4%, both lower declines compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was partly the result of targeted promotional investments made to drive store traffic, which began partway through the quarter.

Our team, in conjunction with the Cub franchisees continues to refine an operating plan expected to drive improving top and bottom line performance as we move further into the fiscal year. Moving to slide 9, let's review profitability drivers in the quarter.

Our gross margin rate, excluding LIFO, was 13.3% of net sales in the first quarter, down about 40 basis points compared to last year, driven by both our wholesale and retail segments. Our wholesale margin rate declined approximately 40 basis points versus last year's Q1 due to changes in business mix at both the customer and the product level, lower procurement gains and ongoing strategic commercial investments.

These were partially offset by progress driving innovation and efficiency, including through supplier programs and reduced shrink. One driver of our shrink improvement this quarter was our work around eliminating waste, a key principle of Lean management.

We've been successful in thoughtfully identifying and focusing our teams on several processes within our distribution centers where our expense ratio has creeped up following the period of COVID and broader supply chain challenges. Our actions have led to lower operating expense, increased capacity and more efficient workflows as well as reduced spoilage.

Retail gross margins were also below last year's Q1 levels, which, as I mentioned earlier, were driven by targeted price and promotional investments made to drive traffic, primarily at Cub. More than offsetting the decrease in gross margin rate was solid execution and management of our operating expenses, which, compared to last year, declined by approximately 65 basis points as a percentage of net sales.

As Sandy stated, we are focused on becoming a more efficient business that is better able to bring value and improving service levels to our customers and suppliers. This has led to consistent efficiency gains across our supply chain where we've generated sequential improvement in throughput for three consecutive quarters and a 5% improvement in cases per hour in Q1 compared to last year's quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter grew nearly 15% compared to prior year quarter to approximately $134 million. Absent the additional week in last year's fourth quarter, this was the fifth consecutive quarter of sequentially improving adjusted EBITDA dollars.

This increased adjusted EBITDA during Q1 was complemented by lower-than-expected costs associated with our accounts receivable monetization facility as well as some investment gains. Together, this more than offset slightly higher amounts for depreciation and amortization and net interest expense. This led to adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share compared to a net loss of $0.04 per share in last year's first quarter.

Flipping to slide 10. As I discussed on our last call, we are implementing Lean principles throughout our business and supply chain and are encouraged with the early operational improvement and financial results we have driven. One major undertaking that we have completed over the last few months is the decentralization of our procurement function.

We've transitioned from having one centralized procurement team to a DC-based organization, bringing them closer to our customers and operations. This has empowered teams to be more directly involved in demand forecasting, allowing for more timely and accurate inventory ordering.

While there have been some initial adjustments along the way, the team is embracing the process, learning and steadily driving improvement. We will continue to focus on driving sustained improvement in this area to help even better align demand with supply and to steadily increase customer service level, a core focus of our multiyear strategy.

The other initiative that I would highlight is the recently completed initial launch of Lean daily management routines and distribution centers in Texas and Colorado where measures of success were built around key performance indicators for safety, quality, delivery and cost, in that order of priority, all meant to create supply chain value for all UNFI stakeholders, including our suppliers and customers.

Initial results showed an 11% improvement in fulfillment quality, 5% improvement in on-time delivery and gains in warehouse labor productivity. As we move through fiscal 2025, we plan to scale Lean daily management processes methodically throughout our network while sustaining our focus on quality and value delivery.

Turning to slide 11. This emphasis on Lean principles helped drive profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow in Q1 was a use of about $159 million, roughly $170 million improvement over the past few fiscal years in which we used close to $330 million in the first quarter of each of these years.

This improvement included paying an incremental $56 million of incentive compensation in the first quarter, which was not paid out in the prior year due to the fiscal 2023 performance. Our first quarter progress were largely due to faster-than-anticipated progress on working capital management. This was partially driven through a shift in how and where we manage inventory.

The decentralization of procurement with the inventory management closer to the end customers, which is particularly important as we focus on the Q2 holiday selling season and delivering strong service to our customers. Because a portion of the year over year favorability is timing related, we would not expect to see the same favorability to last year for each of the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year.

Part of this is also driven by the nonlinear nature of the timing of the cash outflows for our supply chain and automation investments, which is captured in our updated full year outlook for free cash flow. Our Q1 free cash flow was also reduced by nearly $70 million from the strategic decision to reduce the number of customers under our accounts receivable monetization program.

As I suggested on our last call, this program was originally implemented to reduce our effective borrowing cost. However, the cost saving benefit no longer exist, and it makes it neutral from a cost of capital perspective relative to other funding sources.

Although we plan to lower our usage rate of these and similar programs, UNFI retains the flexibility to strategically utilize additional capacity should we choose to do so in the future. As is typical in Q1, our net debt levels increased sequentially and ended the quarter at $2.2 billion of net debt.

This contributed to our net leverage increasing by about 0.2 times of a turn to 4.2 times, which is towards the lower range of the typical historical increase we have seen during our first quarter as we prepare for the holiday selling season. This performance in Q1 keeps us on track with our longer-term deleveraging goals.

Looking at slide 12, fiscal 2025 is off to a solid start, and we're modestly raising our full year outlook for all financial metrics other than capital spending. As outlined in our press release, the updated guidance for net sales is a range of $30.6 billion to $31 billion, which represents a 1.3% full year increase at the midpoint compared to the fiscal 2024 when adjusting for the 53rd week last year.

This represents about an 80 basis points increase in dollar terms from the midpoint of our prior outlook. We have raised the bottom end of our expectations for adjusted EBITDA by $10 million, bringing the new range to $530 million to $580 million, which is a 9% increase over the last year at midpoint.

In terms of cadence for the year, we expect first half adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to the prior year period. This implies total adjusted EBITDA generation will likely be slightly back-half-weighted, reflecting the cadence of actions we're executing as part of our revised strategy and how this builds into results over the balance of the year.

Including the benefit of lower forecasted interest expense and a couple of small below-the-line items, our EPS and adjusted EPS ranges have increased as well with adjusted EPS now expected to fall within the range of $0.40 to $0.80 per share compared to $0.14 last year. Full year free cash flow is now expected to be more than $100 million, which compares to our prior outlook of approximately $100 million, and represents around $200 million in improved year-over-year free cash flow.

As Sandy mentioned, we have completed the closure of both our Billings and Bismarck distribution centers and retained the vast majority of the business, which is now being serviced out of nearby facilities. We're in the process of marketing the real estate underlying both properties, but we will not sacrifice value for time which is the same philosophy we will apply for the Fort Wayne closure and future sale.

As I said in the last quarter, we will continue to evaluate other opportunities along these lines, but have not included any incremental strategic actions in our outlook. Flipping to slide 13, we enter fiscal 2025 with a stronger foundation and operating momentum, which continued through the first quarter of the new year.

Our efficiency initiatives, powered in part by Lean principles, are generating the operating benefits we expected while our volume trends reflect the successful execution of our customers as well as the trust they place in us every day. Our strategy of bringing value to our customers and suppliers through a differentiated value proposition and strengthening service levels while improving UNFI free cash flow is simple and powerful, and we are executing against it.

Sandy, myself and the entire leadership team remain confident and optimistic about our future and the value creation opportunity we have as we work to improve our capabilities and customer-facing execution. Our focus on delivering and deleveraging remains intact, and we look forward to updating you on our progress again next March.

With that, operator, please open the line for questions.

(Operator Instructions) John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Partners.

John Heinbockel

Sandy, I want to start with decentralized procurement. Maybe just talk about balancing, right, you want to manage the inventory locally, but you want to buy it with the benefit of scale. So how you're managing that?

And then when you think about accountability is great, but if you can write alter your or make the compensation program -- make changes there to strengthen accountability, what do you want to do on the compensation side that might be different?

J. Alexander Douglas

John, as we said on the call, a key tenet of our strategy is adding value to our customers and suppliers. And a big part of that is having the products that they need delivered to their stores in a timely fashion. And overall, with those goals in place, we're focused on delivering strong customer fill rates, and we've set the goal of reducing our inventories back to pre-COVID levels within the scope of the multiyear plan.

We view this in some respects, like the shrink goal we've been pursuing over the past five quarters, and we see significant opportunities for improvement both in working capital and in service. Part of achieving better working capital efficiency, as you know, is moving the decision-making and the view closer to the store so that our associates can be involved in the forecasting and the analysis.

And we expect the change to better serve customers and to be a more efficient partner. And we're always looking for ways to align compensation directly with the outcomes that we're seeking in the business. I'd also say that this is early days in this process.

We're continuing to refine the model to make sure that it delivers exactly as it's designed and it's consistent with the Lean principles that Matteo has brought to the company.

John Heinbockel

And maybe as a follow-up, I think you mentioned 5% improvement in cases per hour. I believe that was the number. Now you didn't give what the result was in the two DCs. So I'm curious, I mean, you should see improved productivity beyond that, right, as you roll out Lean. Is that fair?

And when you think about time to -- we implement day one, when do you hit your stride on focus on productivity? Is that -- is it six months out? Is it a year out? Is it longer? What's the timeline?

Giorgio Tarditi

John, it's Matteo. As we discussed in the last call, our goal is to target in between MSD and HSD productivity at our DCs, and that is through a combination of the Lean principles that we're deploying, as well as the benefits and the learning from the automation efforts.

So it's a balance of the two. Specifically at the two distribution centers where we piloted Lean daily management with safety, quality, delivery, cost KPIs, we're seeing the 11% improvement in fulfillment quality, 5% improvement in on-time delivery and also some benefits from a productivity standpoint.

But bear in mind that these are six to eight weeks old initiatives, so there is a lot to ramp up there. And the framework of 6 to 12 months between the deployment of Lean daily management to the other DCs and the learning and the ramping of the automation initiatives is the right framework, and that's how we're thinking extracting $150 million of cost from the roughly $4 billion of total costs from the business in the next three years.

Your updated sales guide implies a deceleration for the balance of the year on a comparable 52-week basis. Just if you could walk us through how you're thinking about inflation and volume as drivers for the balance of the year, underscoring that.

Just surprised, given the new business wins this quarter, that you called out volumes coming in a bit better than expected. Why should that not flow through in a bigger way for the remainder of the year?

Giorgio Tarditi

Leah, thanks for the question. So in the first quarter, we saw volumes growing about 2% in wholesale, delivering total growth of 4.2%. And that was a trend that we picked up in fiscal (inaudible) as you recall, and carried into the early innings of the second quarter.

So we are thinking about the new guidance, which is now at midpoint, $30.8 billion rounding as basically a roughly 1% growth for the remaining nine months of the year, that is balancing three dynamics. One is the strength that we continue to see with our natural customers.

Second is the more modest volume declines that we've seen in conventional. And then third, the ongoing dynamics with the DC optimization. So as Sandy mentioned, we're able to retain the vast majority of our customers in Billings and Bismarck.

We're now going to go through a similar experience with Fort Wayne. And we feel that the balance for the remaining nine months is, again, embedding no risk and no dynamics, but also the strength that we see with the natural business.

And again, the more modest declines that we are seeing in conventional. And we keep the overall commercial backdrop front and center as we think about the execution for the remaining nine months.

Leah Jordan

And then just on a related follow-up, just digging a bit more to the new business gains this quarter driving some of that volume. Which categories are presenting the most opportunities for you now?

And then why do you think these same customers, existing customers are more engaged now? Or how do you think you're resonating more today?

J. Alexander Douglas

Leah, this is Sandy. I guess one of the things that's most interesting about the broader environment is how segmented and differentiated retailers are performing very, very well. I'll give you an example. Multicultural focused customers in many markets are materially outperforming the general market by their differentiated offer and the way they compete.

And obviously, we're focused on providing great support for them as well. You've seen the natural organic performance driving significant growth as well. And so as we think about the way we show up, is making sure that we have the product services and programs that retailers need to drive their strategy.

And inside the shop, there's a lot of growth in fresh. There's -- we mentioned natural products and multicultural products. But we're also bringing professional and digital services that are helping customers compete as well.

I want to ask about the gross margin rate contraction in the quarter, and if you could give us any sense of the outlook there? At least sequentially versus the last couple of quarters, at the end of last year, last fiscal year, there was a pickup in that gross margin contraction.

So you've talked about some of the things that could contract it, let's say, our commercial investments, customer mix and things that were helping with shrink, and other things. Could you just dive a little deeper into the quarter, why the contraction might have been greater than it was?

Why it was greater than it has been? And what's the outlook to the extent you're willing to talk about that?

Giorgio Tarditi

Andy, the gross margin rate in the first quarter at slide 4 was 13.3% versus 13.7% in Q1 of last year and down about 20 basis points or so versus the fourth quarter. Now, notably, it grew $7 million and contributed to $7 million of the $17 million of EBITDA growth.

And if you unpack the $7 million, we actually saw about $13 million of growth in wholesale and a decline related to volume in retail. There are a lot of drivers that go into the gross margin rate, and we commented that the two key drivers were planned customer and product mix, which were partially offset by the improvement in shrink and supplier programs.

Also bear in mind that some of the large customer mix pressure has some offset in OpEx with fewer and lower drops as, again, we scale up our facilities. I would highlight that the -- we continue to be very focused on improving the margin rate, including further shrink improvement.

As Sandy mentioned, we're back to the pre-COVID levels, but we embrace Kaizen and continuous improvement there. We're focused on growing our professional and digital services business that clearly give us some additional calories on the gross margin, as well as private brands, and committed to grow both top and bottom line for retail.

We're also reworking and revamping our commercial screening process, as we commented in the last call. So within the $90 billion resilience space, we continue to look for opportunities to create and get recognition for value with customers and suppliers. So we're very focused on the gross margin conversion and increase in the gross margin conversion as we see sales growing.

On the other side, we're also pleased with the fact that we delivered substantial operating leverage with top line up 4%, operating expense has been down 65 basis points as a percentage of sales, all put into a 15% growth in EBITDA.

Andrew Wolf

Great. I appreciate that granularity. So it sounds like the gross margin rate contraction was much less so, obviously, in wholesale, even though -- I mean, it was more in line with the sales growth. And I think as you spoke to, there was some investment in retail, which I guess, to get the same-store sales improving. And that's why retail gross margin was down year over year, gross profit dollars?

J. Alexander Douglas

I think that's right, Andy. This is Sandy. I would also point out that our retail business grew its EBITDA by $1 million versus prior year also. So it's a part of a rebuild and a strategy that our franchises are -- our franchise community in the Twin Cities is working with our retail leadership to galvanize the brand.

And so we're investing some in price to be more competitive, but we're funding it through the operations. And we're, I would say, optimistic, but early days of the retail turnaround in the Twin Cities.

Andrew Wolf

And if I can ask a much longer focused question, if I will. I think the Lean processes are -- sounds like they're gaining traction pretty rapidly in labor productivity and other efficiencies. But they're pretty new. So I think it's quite reasonable to assume that it's the rightsizing of headcount reduction and less facilities that really is driving the lower operating expenses as adjusted.

And what I really want to get to is, will that mix change over time, when you start heading to the back end of -- the second half to the back end of the fiscal '27 guidance, is it going to be more of the Lean processes that really start to drive labor operating expense efficiencies, more so than I would imagine upfront?

J. Alexander Douglas

Andy, let me do the first half of this and then I'll let Matteo dive into the way the Lean process works. But I would call out on our strategy four key components. The first is organic growth driven by a very resilient $90 billion segment of the industry, a segment where we're seeing retailers grow and a segment where we are designed as a company to serve in a differentiated way.

Secondly, the focus on value added to customers and to suppliers is a key component for how they compete and win, and we're designing products and services and programs to do just that. All of that creates the top line engine and then, clearly, efficiency is a huge component in a $30 billion company with our margins and with the strategy to grow our operating margin sequentially as a core part of value creation.

It's going to be important that we're incredibly efficient. Our customers need us to be -- or suppliers do, and so do our shareholders. And then the final component, optimizing free cash flow is a critically important element as we deleverage the company back to lower levels that we committed to in the three-year plan.

And so I view it really capability-wise as sales and merchandising meeting lean management principles to drive a virtuous cycle. And Matteo, maybe lay out the sequence for Lean as we go forward.

Giorgio Tarditi

Yes. Thank you, Sandy. We are really focused on two areas at the moment from a Lean standpoint. The first one is to deploy Lean daily management as a way to create quick problem-solving and countermeasures at the point of impact. That's why we selected two distribution centers to pilot.

We have a few more implementing the Lean daily management, and we're also embracing it in the functions. The second area is waste elimination, identifying nonvalue-added steps as a way to create capacity, build capabilities and build efficiencies. And that is a process that takes a lot of discipline and probably longer horizons.

But we are very, very focused on applying this methodology as a way to create value and efficiency for our customers and suppliers while remargining UNFI and generating the free cash flow to get to 2.5 times or less leverage by the end of 2027.

This is Ben Wood on for Kelly. I want to start with, first, how is the demand for your services tracking? And where are we in the evolution of some of those programs and offerings? Previously, UNFI had disclosed it was about 20% of EBITDA, which we believe may be a little closer to 30% plus given where EBITDA is expected now. Is that fair? And where do you see services growing at and mixing to longer-term?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. I think we shared that number in beginning of fiscal '22. And at the time, we described services and brands as being a little bit more than 20% of our EBITDA. We've said in less specific ways over the last couple of years that they continue to outgrow the company, and that is certainly our strategy for those businesses.

And I put them into three buckets. There's the professional services that help retailers save money and run their stores, their digital stores that help them modernize their tech stack and begin to attract investment like the early days program we've built around the retail media network.

And then Brands Plus is a broad strategy that we have to fit segmented brand portfolios to different retailers' brand sets. And a good example of that is our natural and organic portfolio, which is growing from mid- to -- mid-single to mid-double digits from a growth perspective.

So we still don't disclose the operating segment as a special segment, but it's a meaningful part of our profitability and even more meaningful part of our growth.

Ben Wood

Great. And then following up on your last point there, Sandy. With some of the success, and it seems pretty drastically different in the natural and organic categories and channels, are you seeing more interest from other parts of your wholesale universe to adopt some of those offerings and put them into their assortment? Are any of your customers trying to chase volume growth by adding more natural and organic categories?

J. Alexander Douglas

I think it's broadly a consumer trend that better-for-you and healthier products are gaining traction, and we're certainly going to follow what our customers want to do from a product and merchandising standpoint. So I think your assumption is right.

The interesting thing that I mentioned earlier, though, is that the whole proposition that the retailer brings is important to their winning. And being in our business, we're in the support business of customers, whatever they're positioning.

And I do think the presumption of your question that natural, organic and specialty products are important is a good one. And certainly, we're seeing that.

Ben Wood

Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, if I may here. Where are we in the rollout of the simplified fee structure? What proportion of your customers are on that? And what's some of the main pushback you're hearing to a faster adoption to that?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. And I think what you're referring to is our supplier go-to-market program and simplified supplier approach. We're well into the rollout of that. The supplier go-to-market program is for large suppliers. It's a customized program.

We're well into the second year of that. And we've seen some really compelling results from suppliers who have been early adopters. The simplified supplier approach, which is for all of our suppliers, takes 15 to 20 fees and eliminate them and replaces them with a single subscription.

And that one has been broadly adopted across the smaller suppliers. I would say where are we in the maturation of the process, I'd answer it two ways. First is we're learning a lot, as our suppliers, and we're working hard to make the tools more accessible and easier.

But I think in the process of the dialogue, we have learned that we have an opportunity more broadly to work on the supplier experience. And we have a whole-of-company effort, that Matteo and I review every week, to improve key aspects of the supplier experience to take friction out, to add transparency and to help our suppliers succeed with the program you asked about, but more broadly in our ecosystem.

Because it's important to our customers that we have the best brands and brands that are comfortable because they can see their business in our ecosystem and they can invest to grow. And so that's why it's such a big priority of ours to improve their experience.

Congrats. Actually, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of those points. And maybe just a bit more on the supplier go-to-market programs, and I think you provided some examples just how successful this has been for certain suppliers, which sounds pretty impactful, so curious on that. And then just how that feeds into your business and profitability specifically.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. I think I'll try to give you a couple of examples so that whether one would be a big supplier and one would be a smaller one. And obviously, I won't name the suppliers, that's up to them to do. But one very large supplier was part of the pilot.

And they brought the strategic objective of trying to capture 35,000 unique SKU retail store distribution opportunities that had fallen off during the supply chain disruption during COVID. And we built an effort to build programming for our retailers that would create the opportunity for retailers to access those brands and get a launch program that the supplier had built.

And we got about 95% of the way to the goal, and it taught us what we could do in that area. And so that's now a part of some of the other customized programs, to help retailers make sure they've got the right products that they want to have, not just the ones they had when the ones they wanted to have ran out. And so that's been a big initiative there.

For smaller suppliers, I think the biggest tool we've given them is the ability to see their sales through our system into retail, which, with that data, they can then target their programming and work with our sales force to try to make sure that their brands are doing as well as possible, particularly in stores that are growing.

And so I would describe the whole thing as a learning process. Early days. The benefit to UNFI is we make slightly higher fees on the bigger suppliers, approximately the same on the medium. And then we still keep fees low, but it's one fee, not 15 to 20.

So it allows suppliers to be able to plan and execute. And as I said earlier in my broader answer, we view the supplier experience as a strategic opportunity for improvement, and we're in very much the early innings. But we're taking action on a weekly basis to try to do it better.

Alex Slagle

That's helpful. And earlier, you mentioned natural and organic portfolio growth and sounded -- mentioned mid-double digits, maybe I got the number wrong, but if you could just clarify what you have commented.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. And no, I said all of that, and it probably was confusing. I was thinking about the three platforms within our natural private brands portfolio. And one of them happens to be growing mid-single, one of them is growing about 10 and one of them is growing about mid-teens. So they're three different brands.

Nice quarter. When you're talking about the new customers, how much of this is business coming back to you that might have been lost during the most difficult parts of integrating the SUPERVALU acquisition?

And how much of it might be getting towards the goal of selling more organic to conventional customers and more conventional product to organic customers prior to the original goal? It's a complex question, but trying to get a sense of where the new business is all coming from.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes, Chuck. The simple answer is that the majority of the major gains is extending our relationship with existing customers. And it's all across the board based on what they're buying from us. We're seeing some natural customers tap into us for specialty portfolios.

We recently had a large natural customer who decided to take conventional products from us. So it really does vary by customer type. I would say if you were to say what's the direction it usually goes, it's usually us expanding natural organic or specialty into customers that don't have all three.

That would be the largest opportunity that we're activating. You don't see as many situations where conventional products go into natural retailers. In fact, you almost never do. So hopefully, that gives you some dimension on what the pipeline is.

Chuck Cerankosky

On the conventional side, where the volume has actually slipped, Sandy, how do you see that playing out going forward, especially if the economy stays where it's at where it was a lot of pressure on budget-constrained consumers?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. What I'd say, Chuck, is it's very hard to paint a brush very far in retail. There are predominantly conventional retailers that are extraordinary brands and are growing very well. You see that with some of the big chains around the country but that are regional.

As I mentioned earlier, predominantly conventional products, but multicultural focused retailers are putting up some of the best numbers in our system. I think the big challenge, and the place where we have work to do with our retail, and there are others that do as well, is the more centrally positioned retailers getting a strategy that's sharper and more differentiated, at least as it's compared to the big discounters.

Right now, the discounters have a fairly substantial price advantage and they're gaining share. And so there's a whole lot of work being done by the balance of the industry to find points of difference and to execute well to improve the value proposition.

Chuck Cerankosky

All right. Thank you very much. Good luck for the rest of the year.

So I was wondering if you can give us, it sounds like you're going to give us a different revenue layout next quarter. But I was wondering if you could maybe frame for us the revenue percentage associated with the legacy UNFI and the legacy SUPERVALU?

J. Alexander Douglas

I believe we have provided that publicly. It's basically half and half.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. And Sandy, how integrated are the businesses? I know we used to talk about, this is a few years ago now, like one bill, one truck, like how integrated are the facilities? How integrated is -- are the two businesses at this stage?

J. Alexander Douglas

The fulfillment systems are not particularly integrated. And the simple reason is that the SKUs are very different. You typically have much higher velocity SKUs in the conventional system, very often full truckload deliveries. Whereas in natural, you can find a much wider range of slower-moving products with smaller drops and multi-drop routes.

And so heretofore, largely because of the interruption that COVID happened, but we've been focused on making those systems work very well. And that's where the Lean process is now engaged. And it's why we speak so optimistically about the potential of Lean because of the work ahead.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. And I'm sure I could dig through filings and stuff like that, but what facilities have you been closing? Are those legacy UNFI or legacy SUPERVALU?

J. Alexander Douglas

They're all three of the ones that have been closed, that Matteo mentioned, Billings, Bismarck and Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne has not yet closed, are all legacy SUPERVALU warehouses. The York closure that moved over to Manchester for 50% more square feet is a Natural building, but we're automating that building.

And that's all being done for growth reasons. It gives us a chance to capture what has been a DC that was operating almost at 180% of capacity. We're now able, with the automation, to continue to drive significant growth in the Mid-Atlantic market for Natural.

Giorgio Tarditi

Scott, all three of them are owned. So as we mentioned, we are starting the process to remarket these three properties.

Scott Mushkin

And the idea there, Matteo, is obviously to pay down debt with those funds?

Giorgio Tarditi

Number one, two and three priorities, that's our capital allocation methodology.

We are in the process. We are not going to trade time for value. So we expect one of them to probably give us some proceeds by the end of fiscal '25 and the other two in the 2026 timeframe.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. Is there anyone else in the queue, or can I have one more?

Okay. So and again, this is something that I know goes back a long time, I think we've talked about it a little bit off and on. But to get cleaner here with the business, it would be nice to get rid of retail, in my mind.

Like where is your head around that, Sandy, and Matteo? Like is that a possibility? I know it's so complicated up in the Twin Cities, but is that something that could go back on the table?

J. Alexander Douglas

And I think, Scott, this is what I said last time. Everything is on the table from the standpoint that if we see a way to create more value for customers and suppliers and our shareholders, most importantly, in this case, we're going to be looking hard at it.

What I would say about retail is Cub is the number one food store brand in the Twin Cities. It's not only owned by UNFI, it's also owned by many of our customers up there. And there's a lot of positive energy for what we can do with Cub even though it's been soft for a couple of years.

And so put all that sales and profit in one place, and it's very linked together from a customer ecosystem standpoint, it's not an easy thing to divest by itself. So the best strategy for us going forward is to keep it together and drive performance.

And that's the plan that the franchisees and we have. But never say never. Obviously, we're going to do what's best for our shareholders.

This is Matthew Rothway on for Mark Carden. You had mentioned on the previous earnings call that you have a goal of achieving another $150 million of cost efficiencies this year. Would you be able to share any more on your outlook there and where we might be able to see that show up?

Giorgio Tarditi

Yes. So what we mentioned in the last call is that part of our three-year strategic plan is to remargin the business with about $150 million of cost out to incremental margins, which as you think about is a similar envelope as we deliver in 2024 as we had a lower exit run rate.

And through a lot of discipline and a lot of efforts, we were able to achieve the $580 million of EBITDA for the year. So we are encouraged by the first quarter. We have about $1 billion of total cost to manage every quarter, and we reduced the OpEx by 65 basis points from 13.5% a year ago to 12.9% this quarter.

And we're really leveraging two or three key principles. The first one is Lean daily management and the identification of waste to find new capacity and new capabilities. That is already finding routes and benefits in throughput and productivity.

We were better in throughput in the last three quarters sequentially and improved 5% year over year. And then we continue to work on a more decentralized organization that allows more effective decision-making and also leaner teams. And we have been able to reduce the total number of employees by 5%, which is also a return to the transformation and severance investments that we made in 2024.

We do that also offsetting some of the higher rents and some of the higher running costs, as you would imagine. So I think that first quarter, as Sandy said, is early innings, but it's a good proof point of our ability to control what we can control.

And knowing that through that high single-digit EBITDA growth that we provided for the next three years, we have a lot of variables under our control. And so we need to continue to apply Lean, continue to be disciplined and provide more proof points.

Operator

I'd now like to hand back over to Sandy Douglas for closing remarks.

J. Alexander Douglas

Thank you, operator. As you heard on today's call, we've made progress executing our multiyear strategy and have early proof points that the strategy is taking hold and creating value for our customers and suppliers while making UNFI a more effective and efficient organization.

We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of improving adjusted EBITDA including mid-teens growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period and meaningfully improved free cash flow compared to the first quarter of prior years. Our increased outlook reflects this performance and our confidence for the balance of the year.

We remain focused on the large opportunity for further improvement and are committed to getting better every day so we can be a clear value creator for customers, suppliers and, in turn, our shareholders. We've embraced Lean management and remain on a path to deliver improving service levels and the longer-term financial objectives we've set for ourselves.

For our customers and suppliers, we thank you for your continued partnership and the business we do together. For the UNFI associates listening today, our thanks to each of you for everything that you do for our business, our customers, our communities and each other.

And for our shareholders, we thank you for the trust you continue to place in us. Thanks again for joining us this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress in March. And we hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday season.

More than 20,000 crossed into South Sudan last week alone, with the number of daily arrivals tripling, compared to previous weeks.

This includes South Sudanese refugees who have been leaving camps in Sudan's White Nile State where fighting between Government and opposition militia is continuing.

""The majority of those displaced are women and children,"" UNHCR said, as it underscored the impact of the conflict on vulnerable populations.

'Extremely worrying'

UNHCR spokesperson Olga Sarrado said some were leaving due to the direct impact of continuing violence but others were fearful ""of how the situation can evolve in the next few days. Our teams are on the ground - UNHCR and partners - but of course, the situation is extremely worrying in terms of humanitarian assistance.""

The UN agency reported people arriving at the main border crossing at Joda, but also at informal crossing points which are extremely difficult to access.

All the new arrivals need life-saving humanitarian support, with water and healthcare the most urgent needs, especially given the ongoing cholera outbreak, UNHCR said.

Paper and wood see 12 per cent fall in demand because of digital media

Global trade in wood and paper products has dropped steeply due to the rise of digital media, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has reported.

After hitting record production levels in 2021 and 2022, the paper trade continued to trail off last year, FAO said.

Taken together, worldwide wood and paper products trade registered a significant drop of 12 per cent in 2023, with exports decreasing by $64 billion, to $482 billion in total.

Papercuts

According to The FAO's Global forest products facts and figures 2023 report, production of paper and paperboard contracted by three per cent, as printed media has been increasingly replaced by digital products. Only wood-based panels recording a marginal growth in production, the UN agency said.

Zhimin Wu, Director of FAO's Forestry Division, said that in addition to growing digitalization, other factors have contributed to the contraction of global paper and wood trade, such as global supply chain disruption, slowing consumer demand and trade restrictions.

Haiti: Gang violence displaces 4,500 people

Armed gangs are continuing to terrorize Haiti's capital, forcing thousands more civilians to abandon their homes that has now displaced more than 700,000 people, the UN reported today.

""The activities of armed gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince continue to disrupt people's lives, especially the most vulnerable,"" UN Spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at the Noon Briefing in New York.

""The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that between 6 and 8 December, more than 4,500 people have become newly displaced due to ongoing insecurity,"" Mr. Dujarric said.

Despite security challenges, humanitarian operations continue. ""During the first week of December, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed more than 100,000 hot meals to 24,000 people across four displacement sites in the capital,"" Mr. Dujarric noted.

IOM has delivered water to approximately 14,000 displaced people across six sites, while also providing medical care and mental health support to more than 12,000 people forced from their homes.

supply chain disruption,FM says global conflicts fuel inflation; calls for normalcy,FortuneIndia,https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/fm-says-global-conflicts-fuel-inflation-calls-for-normalcy/119512,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said global wars and skirmishes are leading to inflation due to the impact on supply chains and food value chain disruption. Listing out decadal priorities at CII's Global Economic Policy Forum in New Delhi today, Sitharaman stressed restoring normalcy in the global geopolitics, avoiding concentration risk in global supply chains, climate change, and global food security and quality life for those engaged in agriculture.

""The attempt of the industry and the government everywhere should be to restore global calm. Restore some normalcy. Nowhere can there be enough justifiable reasons for skirmishes or war. The global priority for this decade must be to restore normalcy and talk out the issues. War should be avoided, disruption should be avoided. They are the main cause of supply chain disruptions and disruption of food value chains. If you look at it, inflation globally is a big challenge,"" Sitharaman said.

""But inflation, as you know, does not respect borders. Inflation is so contagious. No country's effort today is completely successful because beyond its powers the inflation forces come in. Therefore the primary cause I would think is the disruption, the war. And, as a result, the world is facing a challenge which in many ways is reflected in our economy. So I would think it is incumbent upon all of us -- industry, government, policymakers and citizens' forum, to try tirelessly to have some normalcy,"" Sitharaman adds.

Sitharaman also advocated the need to look beyond concentrated supply chains. ""The second is the oft-discussed problem -- the supply chain and supply chain disruption.

The brand sells directly through its website, www.procook.co.uk, and through 64 own-brand retail stores, located across the UK.

Founded over 25 years ago as a family business, selling cookware sets by direct mail in the UK, ProCook has grown into a market leading, multi-channel specialist kitchenware company, employing over 600 colleagues, and operating from its Store Support Centre in Gloucester.

As a B Corp, a Real Living Wage employer and a certified Great Place to Work, ProCook is committed to being a socially responsible and environmentally conscious business for the benefit of all stakeholders.

ProCook has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since November 2021 (PROC.L).

Underlying operating loss, underlying loss before tax and underlying EBITDA are presented before non-underlying items of £0.3m in H1 FY25 (H1 FY24: £1.5m) in relation to IPO-related share-based awards and, in FY24, transition and dual running costs in respect of the Group's new Store Support Centre

UK Kitchenware market growth (excluding ProCook) calculated using weekly GfK data and management estimates.

FY25 LFL (Like For Like) revenue reflects:

- Ecommerce LFL - ProCook direct website channel only.

- Retail LFL - Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to 31 March 2024, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.

FY24 LFL (Like For Like) revenue reflects:

- Ecommerce LFL - ProCook direct website channel only.

- Retail LFL - Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to 2 April 2023, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.

The LFL revenue growth % by quarter for Q1 and Q2 FY25 has been adjusted to exclude the closures of two garden centre stores which were closed during Q3 FY25 and were previously included within LFL revenue.

Our first half trading performance has been encouraging, with continued momentum in revenue growth and positive like for like momentum in both Retail and Ecommerce channels. We have attracted more new customers to shop with us year on year, and our L12M active customer base is at a record high of 1.1m customers, having increased by +11.7% year on year.

We are well positioned for the remainder of the important peak trading period, having expanded our store footprint and ranges, with strong inventory levels secured. Trading in the first eight weeks of the second half, including Black Friday, has shown improving momentum after a subdued start to the period which coincided with the Budget event, and our Christmas campaign will provide customers with our award-winning quality at great value prices.

Continued trading momentum in challenging conditions

The consumer backdrop remains difficult, with improving trends in consumer confidence stalling more recently, fuelled by uncertainty around the recent UK Budget, and wider macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The kitchenware market remains subdued, with limited growth, with the lack of consumer confidence impacting discretionary spending.

Against this backdrop, I am pleased that we grew market share during the first half with revenue growth of +7.5% year on year and like for like revenue growth of +4.2%.

We have now delivered five consecutive quarters of like for like growth in Retail stores, and by expanding our store network, with the addition of four new stores in H1, our total Retail revenue growth was +6.5%.

Ecommerce revenue grew by +9.4% year on year, with like for like growth of +8.5%, recuperating much of the disruption from the previous year's website migration. Additionally, our re-launch of sales through Amazon UK contributed the balance of +0.9% points of growth.

We have continued to invest in offering outstanding value for customers during the first half, retaining the lower prices we implemented in H2 last year for the majority of the first half. Therefore, our revenue growth has been driven by volume and transaction growth, with a 160bps reduction in gross margin, in line with our expectations for the first half.

We have maintained strong cost discipline throughout the first half, with operating costs as a percentage of revenue slightly lower year on year, despite inflationary headwinds. This resulted in a £1.1m increase in underlying operating costs as we have grown; we continue to focus on improving operating efficiency for the medium term to offset the impacts of inflation on our business, especially in pay costs. As a result, our underlying operating loss in H1 increased by £0.3m to £1.8m compared to FY24 H1.

H2 is the Group's critical trading period, as it typically represents approximately 60% of revenue each year and this seasonal weighting provides improved operating leverage over our fixed cost base. We have improved our Black Friday and Christmas offers for customers, and with the right inventory on hand we are well prepared.

Delivering on our strategic plan

In June we set out our plan to achieve our medium-term ambition of operating 100 retail stores in the UK, growing revenue to £100m and delivering 10% operating profit margins, and we are making good progress with the actions we set out.

We opened four new stores in the first half, followed by five new stores during the first seven weeks of the second half (nine new stores in the year to date). After closing two smaller and less profitable garden centre stores, we now operate from 64 stores. We now plan to open a further three new stores in the balance of this financial year taking our new store tally for FY25 to 12. Our new property pipeline for FY26 is taking shape already and we are encouraged by both the performance in the new stores thus far, and the opportunity these new stores present to deliver profitable growth, better leverage our fixed cost base, and build brand awareness.

High quality and great value products are critical to our continued success, and I am pleased with the progress we have made in this regard, as highlighted by Good Housekeeping, Which? and Ideal Home. We have expanded our promotional Black Friday and seasonal Christmas offers, and increased the range of small kitchen electricals we now offer following phase 3 launch in Summer. Phase 4 of small kitchen electricals (coffee) is on track to launch during Q4. We continue with efforts to consolidate our supplier base which will improve quality, service and cost price.

We have continued our relentless drive to ensure our customer service and experience is the very best it can be. We now monitor NPS in retail stores and online transactions, using learnings and customer feedback to enhance service levels and experience. Our focus on User Experience online has enhanced conversion rates year on year and we have developed and deployed a series of enhancements during the year thus far.

Building brand awareness remains one of our largest opportunities. Opening the 12 new stores planned for FY25 will give us access to new centre visitors in excess of 150m per year that we previously did not serve. Additionally, we have made substantial headway in developing our social marketing activities, and our mix of spend between digital channels has already shifted and is delivering improved marketing efficiency. Concurrently, we have made good progress in developing more inspirational and lifestyle-centred marketing campaigns, including for Autumn and Christmas, and we have begun developing our online recipe bank for customers. We are confident these actions will support greater engagement and connectivity with our brand. We also took the decision to launch a curated range on Amazon UK, enabling more customers to discover us for the first time, whilst also providing a convenient next day service for those who choose to shop this way.

Our supply chain transformation programme is a multi-year initiative, but early progress has been strong. Our team have shifted thinking to end-to-end cost effectiveness. Key initiatives launched in the first half include warehouse operations pick and pack efficiencies, trialling a new delivery partner with caged deliveries for the South-East region, and increasing delivery frequency to improve on shelf availability whilst reducing store inventory levels. These initiatives will, over time, enable us to run a more efficient business.

Current trading and outlook

In the first eight weeks (ending 8 December 2024) of the second half, including Black Friday and the early part of Christmas trading, total revenue was +7.5% year on year, and like for like revenue was +0.9% reflecting continued trading momentum and market outperformance.

Retail performance was hampered by weak footfall during the early weeks of the second half which coincided with the Budget event, and a later Black Friday year on year, but has improved since. As a result, Retail like for like revenue was -4.0% year on year, however new store openings added +10.3% points to deliver total Retail revenue growth of +6.3%. Ecommerce performance continued to increase year on year with like for like growth of +7.7% and total growth of +9.3% including revenue generated from the recently re-launched Amazon UK marketplace channel.

Whilst the important Q3 trading period had a subdued start in the early weeks, we are well positioned to take advantage of the improved momentum we are now experiencing, supported by our Christmas campaign, new product launches and strong inventory levels.

Notwithstanding recent continued challenging trading conditions, our expectations for the Group's full year performance are unchanged, as we anticipate our typical second half weighting of revenue and profitability, supplemented by the actions we have taken to expand our retail network, alongside continued margin and cost discipline.

Accelerating profitable growth

Having returned to profitability last year, we are now committed to building on this and achieving our medium-term ambition to grow our store network to 100 UK stores, delivering revenue of £100m and improving operating profit margins to 10%.

The trading momentum of the first half and the eight weeks since, combined with the strategic progress we have made, provides encouragement that we are taking the right steps, and that despite the macro headwinds, we are building improved resilience and a performance culture that can deliver.

The fundamentals of our business model are strong and becoming stronger, and the Leadership Team, Board and I are eager to progress the many opportunities we have to build a stronger customer-focused business. As market conditions improve, the actions we are taking, and investments we are making now will help us accelerate and deliver profitable and sustainable growth for our stakeholders.

I am excited by the journey we are on, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank all our colleagues for their effort, commitment and customer focus over the first part of this financial year.

The market remains challenging and volatile as consumer confidence is impacted by cost-of-living pressures, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Against this backdrop, we have delivered a strong performance in the first half, outperforming a subdued market and growing our customer base.

We maintain a tight grip on gross margins and operating costs, balancing the need to offer the best possible value to customers in a competitive market, whilst driving improved profitability. We have worked to mitigate, where possible, the effects of inflation, through operating efficiencies and improved business processes.

As a result of the global supply chain disruption, we prudently ordered inventory earlier than normal, to ensure that we were well positioned for the peak trading period.

We have made good progress against our strategic priorities, and we continue to invest in the areas which will support our performance and deliver profitable growth for the long term, including in particular this year our new store opening programme which is a key part of our strategy.

The first half of the financial year typically generates around 40% of full year sales. The larger and far more profitable second half of the year typically delivers around 60% of sales, and with strong inventory levels and a robust trading plan in place we are well placed for the remainder of the second half.

First half revenue of £28.3m was +7.5% year on year, and +4.2% on a like for like basis, reflecting continued trading momentum and +5% market outperformance.

Ecommerce revenue increased by +9.4% reflecting a significantly improved performance on last year (which was impacted by the new website migration in Q2) driven by conversion and marketing improvements. The planned relaunch of sales on the Amazon UK marketplace to broaden our customer reach contributed +0.9% points of non-like for like growth in the second quarter.

Retail revenue increased by +6.5% benefitting from the fifth consecutive quarter of positive like for like growth (+1.9% for the first half) and the impact of new store openings which added a further 4.6% points.

Gross profit

Gross profit increased +5.1% year on year to £18.4m, driven by revenue growth. This represented a gross profit margin decrease of 160bps which was primarily due to investment in improved pricing for customers (-210bps), increased freight costs (-30bps) and mix effect (-60bps), partly offset by favourable foreign exchange impacts (+130bps) and lower promotional discounts (+20bps).

Operating expenses and other income

Underlying operating expenses net of other income

Total underlying operating expenses net of other income increased by £1.1m (+6.3%) year on year, although despite inflationary headwinds, were 120bps lower year on year as a percentage of revenue, driven by:

It is the Group's policy to disclose separately such items that relate to non-recurring events and are material in nature, and incurred outside of the normal business operations, in order to provide a consistent and comparable view of the underlying performance of the Group. Non-underlying operating expenses in H1 FY25 were £0.3m (H1 FY24: £1.4m).

Consistent with prior periods, expenses in respect of employee share-based awards which relate to the IPO in FY22, which itself is non-recurring, have been presented as non-underlying costs. These expenses amounted to £0.3m in H1 FY25 (H1 FY24: £0.7m). These expenses are expected to continue through relevant vesting periods to the third anniversary of the IPO in November 2024.

During the first half of FY24, we completed the final elements of transition into our new SSC. Operating expenses associated with the costs of transitioning into the new site and the dual occupancy of the new and previous sites were £0.9m in H1 FY24.

Operating profit / (loss)

Total underlying operating loss for the period increased year on year to £1.8m (H1 FY24: £1.5m) primarily driven by the lower gross margins in the first half. Ecommerce operating margins decreased to 18.8% (H1 FY24: 20.5%) and Retail operating margins decreased to 11.9% (H1 FY24: 13.6%).

Total reported operating loss in the first half of FY25 of £2.1m, after £0.3m of non-underlying operating expense items, improved by £0.9m from £3.0m H1 FY24.

Profit and earnings per share

Underlying losses before tax increased by 64.7% year on year to £2.9m in the first half of FY25 (H1 FY24: £1.7m).

During the first half there was a net expense of £1.1m (H1 FY24: £0.2m net expense) in respect of financial items. Financial items included interest expenses on lease liabilities and borrowings of £0.7m (H1 FY24: £0.7m), and unrealised losses of £0.4m in respect of foreign exchange (H1 FY24: £0.5m unrealised gains).

After non-underlying items, the loss before tax was £3.2m (H1 FY24: £3.2m). Reported loss after tax was £2.5m (H1 FY24: £2.4m).

The effective tax rate based on underlying loss before tax was 25.0% (H1 FY24: 25%).

Earnings per Share

Underlying basic earnings per share for the first half decreased to -1.98 pence (H1 FY24: -1.18 pence) and underlying diluted earnings per share decreased to -1.98 pence (H1 FY24: -1.18 pence).

Reported basic earnings per share for the first half were -2.30 pence (H1 FY24: -2.22 pence) and reported diluted earnings per share were -2.30 pence (H1 FY24: -2.22 pence).

Cash generation and net debt

We have carefully managed our cash position during the first half, with net debt increasing by £3.4m since the FY24 year end reflecting investment in new stores, the typical seasonal impacts of lower cash generation during the first half and the requirement to build inventory ahead of peak trading in Q3.

Free cash outflow for the first half was £3.4m (H1 FY24: outflow of £0.3m, including +£2.6m benefit of Net Working Capital as inventory was reduced) with net debt at the period end of £4.2m (FY24 year end: £0.7m; H1 FY24: £3.2m) and available liquidity of £11.8m.

The reported loss before tax in the first half includes £0.3m of non-underlying items which did not result in cash outflows during the period (H1 FY24: £1.5m of non-underlying items of which £0.7m were cash outflows).

An increase in net working capital resulted in a cash outflow of £0.3m in the first half (H1 FY24: £2.6m inflow) driven by increased inventory intake prior to the peak trading period, as a result of prudent planning in response to global supply chain disruption. Inventory on hand at the half year was therefore £12.9m, £4.4m higher year on year, and up from £8.3m at the FY24 year end. Total inventory at the half year was £16.9m (H1 FY24: £11.9m).

Net capital expenditure of £1.3m in the first half related to the planned investment in new retail stores.

Full year guidance

Our expectations for the full year remain unchanged. The second half reflects the seasonal impact of higher trading volumes over Black Friday and Christmas, and the effect this has to improve leverage of our fixed cost base.

Additionally, we anticipate H2 gross profit margins to improve modestly compared to H1 driven by FX benefits and targeted price improvements. The new stores opened in H1 will provide a benefit to profitability in H2, and we expect to continue to drive operating efficiencies throughout the second half.

The recent Budget announcements around National Insurance Contributions will not impact this financial year, but will add approximately £0.5m of additional tax burden next financial year, which we will endeavour to offset through continual process improvements. As a Real Living Wage employer, the announcements around the increased National Living Wage were already factored into our plans and we continue to pay all colleagues, no matter their age, in excess of the adult National Living Wage.

Banking arrangements

The Group has access to a committed £10m Revolving Credit Facility (""RCF"") to provide additional cash headroom to support operational and investment activities. This facility expires in April 2026 and provides an accordion option, subject to the lender's approval, to extend the facility by a further £5m.

The RCF facility has covenant terms in respect of fixed charge cover whereby the test requires EBITDAR to be no less than 1.30x fixed charges for the FY25 Q1 and Q2 test dates, and 1.40x thereafter, and also leverage whereby net debt should be no greater than 2.0x EBITDA. Both covenants are tested quarterly and are calculated on a last twelve month rolling, pre-IFRS 16 basis.

The Group's ability to meet these covenants has been stress tested as part of going concern considerations, which is described in more detail below.

The Group has retained its access to an existing uncommitted £6.0m trade finance facility, which is due to expire in February 2025, although is expected to be renewed at that date. There is a performance KPI (inventory to payables ratio), which is monitored on a quarterly basis, however, there are no covenants or guarantees or other collateral associated with this facility.

Capital allocation and dividend policy

In normal circumstances, the Board currently believes that, to ensure operating flexibility through the business cycle, it must maintain a minimum unrestricted cash / debt headroom which the Board reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently as required. Maintaining this headroom provides a level of flexibility sufficient to fund the working capital and investment needs of the Group (as well as set aside an appropriate operating reserve for unexpected events).

The Group's dividend policy targets an ordinary dividend pay-out ratio of 20% to 30% of profit after tax during the financial year to which the dividend relates. The Board anticipates, under normal circumstances, that it will consider returning surplus cash to shareholders if average cash / debt headroom over a period consistently exceeds the minimum headroom target, subject to known and anticipated investment plans at the time.

The full capital and dividend policy is available on the Group's website at www.procookgroup.co.uk.

Dividends

Due to the ongoing challenging consumer environment and the uncertainty that it creates around trading performance, and therefore taking a cautious and responsible decision to preserve cash within the business during these times, the Board have not recommended any interim dividend in respect of FY25.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The Board regularly reviews and monitors the risks and uncertainties which could have a material effect on the Group's results. A summary of the principal risks is set out below:

The Directors confirm that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8, namely:

- An indication of important events that have occurred during the first half of the year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the financial year; and

- Material related-party transactions in the first half of the year and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.

The Directors of the Company are listed in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024. A list of current Directors is maintained on the Company's corporate website: www.procookgroup.co.uk.

Consolidated Statement of cash flows (Unaudited)

Consolidated statement of changes in equity (Unaudited)

The deferred tax asset in the financial year ending 2 April 2023 has been restated in relation to deferred tax on share-based payments, with resulting decreases to retained earnings. Further information relating to this restatement is set out in the Group's FY24 Annual Report and Accounts.

Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting Policies (Unaudited)

The Group interim financial statements consolidate those of ProCook Group plc (the 'Company') and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the 'Group'.

ProCook Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 (Registration number: 13679248). The registered office is ProCook, 10 Indurent Park, Gloucester, GL10 3EZ.

The principal activity of the Company together with its subsidiary undertakings throughout the period is the sale of kitchenware and related products in stores and via ecommerce platforms.

The Group's financial results and cashflows are subject to seasonal trends throughout the financial period. Typically, revenue and profit are higher in the last 24 weeks of the financial year due to the seasonal impact of increased trade in the run up to Christmas.

Basis of preparation

These condensed interim financial statements for the 28 weeks ended 13 October 2024 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim financial information"". These condensed interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 and are not audited.

The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, which were prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, UK-adopted IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Statutory financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 25 June 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors have reported on those financial statements; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) contained a reference to the material uncertainty in respect of going concern to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without modifying their report, (iii) did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

The presentation of the condensed financial statements requires Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Basis of consolidation

Group companies included in these consolidated interim financial statements include ProCook Group plc and all subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities it controls. ProCook Group plc controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to ProCook Group plc until the date that control ceases. The Company assesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes in the control indicators listed above.

Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the financial information. Losses are eliminated in the same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Going concern

The interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group had net debt (cash and cash equivalents less borrowings) of £4.2m at 13 October 2024 (15 October 2023: £3.2m) with available liquidity headroom of £11.8m.

In their assessment of going concern the Board has considered a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. In considering whether it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements, the Directors have considered the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and have assessed the impact of a range of downside scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario, on the Group's expected financial performance, position, and cash generation. The scenarios have been informed by a comprehensive review of the macroeconomic environment, including consideration of the current weakened consumer confidence driven by economic uncertainty, alongside geo-political tensions including the impacts on our supply chain.

Consideration has been given to the availability of facility headroom and covenant compliance within the Group's financing facilities, the recently extended RCF agreement and amended fixed charge covenant terms, details of which are as follows:

- ProCook's bank facility agreements include a committed £10m Revolving Credit Facility ""RCF"" (expiring in April 2026, although expected by management to be renewed at that date), with a £5m accordion option to the RCF, subject to lender approval, and an uncommitted £6m trade finance facility.

- The RCF facility has covenant terms in respect of fixed charge cover whereby the test requires EBITDAR to be no less than 1.30x fixed charges for the FY25 Q1 and Q2 test dates, and 1.40x thereafter, and also leverage whereby net debt should be no greater than 2.0x EBITDA. Both covenants are tested quarterly and are calculated on a last twelve month rolling, pre-IFRS 16 basis.

The base case for the scenario modelling reflects the Group's most recent quarterly forecast that was presented to the Board in November 2024. Forecasts for FY26 are based on the Group's strategic objectives and its latest five year financial plan, which projects forwards from the latest FY25 quarterly forecast.

Key assumptions include Ecommerce and Retail like for like revenue growth, gross margin performance, the financial impacts of opening of new stores (including capital investments and time to maturity), operational efficiencies being delivered, investment in marketing activity, and the appropriate level of inventory required to maintain strong product availability for customers.

In their consideration of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties the Board believes that the most likely and most impactful risks that the Group faces are those surrounding customer and macro-economic factors, and supply chain disruption risk, and finance and treasury risks (foreign exchange on account of the US presidential elections) all of which are heightened as a result of the current macro-environment.

The Board has reviewed the potential downside impact of these risks unfolding, modelled under a number of scenarios including a severe but plausible downside scenario which reflected the following assumptions:

- A significant reduction in customer demand and shopping frequency, caused by continued disposable income pressures and consumer caution in light of political uncertainty, additional cost impacts driven by continued supply chain disruption associated with the Suez Canal diversions, and FX impacts on gross profit margins from a stronger US dollar.

- The impacts of these factors have been reflected in an 6% lower revenue performance in the balance of the FY25 year compared to base case, increasing to a 10% decrease in FY26, combining to reflect a 38% reduction in Group revenue growth over the assessment period compared to the base case.

- A reduction in gross margins in the balance of FY25 compared to the base case of 100bps and by 200bps in FY26 to reflect heightened supply chain costs and a weaker GBP compared to the US dollar for product purchasing.

Under this severe but plausible downside scenario, and before mitigating actions, the Group would remain comfortably within its available borrowing facilities throughout the assessment period and remain compliant with the fixed charge covenant test. However, it would breach the leverage covenant at the Q2 FY26 test date given the level of planned and committed inventory intake and new store openings during the remainder of FY25 and first half of FY26.

The other downside scenario linked to the key principal risks and uncertainties, which was considered by the Board, had a less severe cumulative impact than the severe but plausible downside scenario outlined above and in this scenario neither of the covenants would be breached, and the Group would remain comfortably within its available borrowing facilities throughout the assessment period.

The Board has also considered the potential impacts of climate change risks. These are not considered to have a material effect on the Group's financial projections over the assessment period.

If any of the downside scenarios were to arise, including the severe but plausible downside scenario, there are a series of mitigating actions that the Group could seek to implement to protect or enhance financial performance and position including to:

- Increase selling prices for products which have lower price elasticity to help offset additional sourcing costs

- Increase promotional activity to accelerate trading performance and reduce stock levels, or alternatively, reduce promotional activity to better protect gross margins

- Reduce paid media marketing spend and postpone or reduce other planned marketing activities

- Reduce variable costs in operational functions to reflect the lower sales volumes

- Reduce central overhead costs (including headcount investment) over the short or medium term

- Delay new store openings or capital expenditure in technology and logistics

- Renegotiate or seek extended payment terms with suppliers on a permanent or temporary basis

- Seek alternative forms of financing or new banking terms to support working capital and investment requirements

Conclusion

The Board has undertaken a comprehensive review and assessment of going concern including the Group's financial projections, debt servicing requirements, available facility headroom and liquidity, and its principal risks and uncertainties. In the base case and downside scenarios which the Directors have reviewed, the Group remains comfortably within its available facility headroom, and no facility covenants would be breached. However, the Directors recognise that under the severe but plausible downside scenario, the Group could breach its leverage covenant unless mitigating actions were to be successfully applied sufficiently in advance to prevent such a breach, or were it to agree a covenant waiver, new banking terms, or alternative funding arrangements, none of which can be guaranteed. The Directors therefore acknowledge that this potential breach represents a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Board considers the likelihood of such a severe downside scenario materialising to be low and recognises the range of mitigating actions available to the Group to prevent such a breach occurring, and the positive and long-standing relationship which the Group has with its banking partner HSBC. The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of at least 12 months from the date of approving these financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis of accounting.

Accounting Policies

The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and share based payments which are stated at their fair value. The accounting policies adopted, as well as significant judgements and key estimates applied, are consistent with those in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, as described in those financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Group revenue is not reliant on any single major customer or group of customers. Management considers revenue to be derived from one business stream being the retail of kitchenware and related products and services.

Customers interact and shop with the Group across multiple touchpoints and their journey often involves more than one channel. The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors of ProCook Group plc. The Board reviews internal management reports on a frequent basis, and in line with internal reporting, the channel reporting below indicates where customers complete their final purchase transaction.

All of the Group's operations are carried out in the UK during H1 FY25. All revenue is from external customers.

Consistent with prior periods, expenses in respect of employee share-based awards which relate to the IPO event in FY22, which itself is non-recurring, have been presented as non-underlying costs. These expenses are expected to continue through relevant vesting periods to the third anniversary of the IPO in November 2024.

During the first half of the prior year, the Group completed the final elements of consolidation of its head office and warehouse operations into its new Store Support Centre (""SSC""). Operating and finance expenses associated with the costs of transitioning into the new site and the dual occupancy of the new or previous sites were £0.9m, and were presented as non-underlying costs as these items are non-recurring, dual-running and transition-related.

The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) has been identified as the Board of Directors and segmental reporting analysis is presented based on the Group's internal reporting to the Board. At 13 October 2024, the Group had two operating segments, being Ecommerce and Retail. Central costs are reported separately to the Board. Whilst central costs are not considered to be an operating segment, it has been included below to aid reconciliation with operating profit as presented in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Non-underlying finance costs are the interest costs on the lease liabilities for the disused warehouses in FY24.

Substantially all of the assets of the Group are located in the UK.

The underlying effective tax rate for the 28 weeks ending 13 October 2024 is 25.0% (28 weeks ended 15 October 2023: 25%; year ended 31 March 2024: 16.4%). Tax expense has been provided for in H1 FY25 at the prevailing tax rate of 25%.

The standard rate of UK corporate income tax was 25% for all periods presented.

No final dividend was declared in respect of the period ended 31 March 2024 and the Group has not declared an interim dividend in respect of the current half year period.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Underlying earnings per ordinary share is a non-IFRS measure.

In the 28 weeks ended 13 October 2024 and 15 October 2023 the impact of share options was anti-dilutive.

The Group leases a number of assets, with all lease payments fixed over the lease term. Where there are leasehold properties which hold a variable element to lease payments made these are not capitalised as part of the right of use asset. All expected future non-variable cash out flows are reflected within the measurement of the lease liabilities at each period end.

Remeasurements have arisen where store lease rental terms and/ or lease expiry dates have been amended.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the 28 weeks ending 13 October 2024 amounted to £9.9m (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: £8.8m).

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks and investments in money market instruments. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the financial year as shown in the statement of cash flows can be reconciled to the related items in the statement of financial position as follows:

The Group's local currency is pounds sterling however but due to purchases of goods and services in foreign currencies the Group seeks to reduce foreign exchange risk by entering into forward contracts and other derivatives. At 13 October 2024, the outstanding contracts all mature within 28 months of the period end, with committed purchases of $33.7m (31 March 2024: $20.8m).

The contracts are measured at their fair value, which is determined using valuation techniques that utilise observable inputs. The key inputs used in valuing the derivatives are the forward exchange rates. There were no designated hedges in place during the current or proceeding financial year.

The fair value of derivative financial assets, included within Trade and other receivables, are as follows:

The fair value of derivative financial liabilities, included within Trade and other payables, are as follows:

The Group is exposed through its operation to the following financial risks: credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk. Risk management is carried out by the Directors of the Group. The Group uses financial instruments to provide flexibility regarding its working capital requirements and to enable it to manage specific financial risks to which it is exposed.

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of debt finance, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors and trade payables which arise directly from the Business's operations.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. To minimise the risk, the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial exposure, is continuously monitored. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of its financial receivables, trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the notes to the financial information.

The receivables' age analysis is evaluated on a regular basis for potential doubtful debts, considering historic, current, and forward-looking information. No impairments to trade receivables have been made to date. Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables are provided within the notes to financial statements.

Credit risk also arises on cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating ""B+"" are accepted.

Currently all financial institutions whereby the Group holds significant levels of cash are rated A+ to A-.

Interest rate risk

As at 13 October 2024 the Group's drawn borrowings are through its trade finance facility with a floating interest rate linked to the United States Federal funds rate and its revolving credit facility with a floating interest rate linked to the Bank of England base rate. Both are variable on the amount drawn down and there is no fixed settlement date, therefore the interest rate risk exposure for the Group is minimal. The Group's policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial borrowings. The Group does not currently use any form of derivatives to manage interest rate volatility or future rate increases, however it does seek to minimise interest costs through careful management of its use of facilities.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk arises when the Group enters transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. The Group's policy is, where possible, to settle liabilities denominated in a currency other than its functional currency with cash already denominated in that currency.

The Group makes purchases of goods and services from overseas in foreign currencies and uses additional means to cover its exposure to the foreign exchange movement. The Group uses various financial derivatives such as forward exchange contracts, to help mitigate movements in foreign currency to restrict losses and to ascertain control of expected cash out flows. All the Group's foreign exchange contracts are designated to settle the corresponding liability.

The Group seeks to maintain sufficient cash balances to support its working capital and investment requirements. Management reviews cash flow forecasts on a regular basis to determine whether the Group has sufficient cash available to support its operational and investment activities.

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

Transactions with Life's a Beach, a related party by virtue of one of the Group's Directors during the period (Daniel O'Neill) being a trustee, relate to charitable donations made on ProCook sales and other associated transactions. During the period, ProCook sales generated £19k of donations payable to Life's a Beach (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: £17k). During the period ending 13 October 2024, ProCook made payments totalling £55k to Life's a Beach (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: nil). The amount payable at 13 October 2024 was £13k (15 October 2023: £23k).

Transactions with Conway House Limited, a related party by virtue of one of the Group's Directors (Daniel O'Neill) being a Director of the company, relate to the provision of advisory services to the Group. During the period, Conway House Limited provided services totalling £69k (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: nil). Payments to Conway House totalled £47k during the period (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: nil). The amount payable at 13 October 2024 was £22k (28 weeks ending 15 October 2023: nil).

Transactions with Quella Bicycle Limited, a related party by virtue of one of the Group's Directors during the period (Daniel O'Neill) holding a financial interest, have previously related to the renting of warehouse space from ProCook Limited. Quella vacated the premises in March 2023, therefore no charges were made in the period H1 FY25 (H1 FY24: nil). The amount receivable at 13 October 2024 was nil (16 October 2023: £9k).",,", ",,N/A,N/A,"Parent, England, UK, +5%, Retail, US, Wales, FY26, Gloucester, Q4, Beach"

Innovations such as blockchain, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), IoT (Internet of Things), and QR codes have revolutionized the way food products are tracked and monitored throughout the supply chain. These technologies offer unparalleled capabilities in terms of data accuracy, real-time monitoring, and seamless integration with existing systems. By leveraging these advanced tracking technologies, stakeholders in the food industry can effectively trace the movement of products from farm to fork, enabling rapid identification and response to potential issues or recalls.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of food traceability in ensuring resilience and continuity in the supply chain. The disruption caused by the pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional supply chain models, prompting stakeholders to reevaluate their approach to food safety and traceability. As a result, there has been an accelerated adoption of digital traceability solutions that enable remote monitoring, contactless transactions, and supply chain visibility, thereby enhancing the resilience of the food supply chain in the face of future crises.

supply chain disruption,Long-delayed psychiatric centre expects first patients next week,Cayman Compass,https://www.caymancompass.com/2024/12/10/poinciana-psychiatric-centre-expects-first-patients-next-week/,"Long-delayed psychiatric centre expects first patients next week

The political drama of Cayman's much-delayed, $24 million residential mental health centre took a step closer to ending with its official opening on Tuesday.

Politicians and guests gathered at the Poinciana Rehabilitation Centre in East End as the 54-bed unit officially opened, years behind schedule. It is expected to admit Caymanian patients returned from Jamaica before Christmas.

Dwayne Seymour, recently taking on the role of wellness minister, saw the centre through to its handover to its staff. He said he was delighted to see the ""state-of-the-art"" complex, which was dogged with problems and bad luck, including COVID-19 disruption, completed.

Seymour added, it was ""a long-awaited and much-anticipated occasion for our nation - the grand opening of the Poinciana Rehabilitation Centre"".

He said patients who needed residential psychiatric care ""for far too long"" had been forced to go to Jamaica or elsewhere for treatment, which deprived them of family support, a ""part of the therapeutic process"".

He fought back tears as he revealed his own father, who was in a Jamaican residential psychiatric unit for years, died of a heart attack in 2011 at age 75 just days before his planned return to his homeland.

Seymour said the centre in East End would ensure ""residents are supported and remain connected to the friends and families and the broader community"".

He said he had, as minister of health in a previous administration, worked to make the Poinciana centre a reality, which had attracted broad support in Parliament.

In-patient psychiatric services are available at George Town Hospital, but they were designed for short stays rather than long-term rehabilitation.

The project, which started construction in 2019, suffered multiple delays. The coronavirus pandemic forced a complete shutdown for some time.

When work restarted, it was at first under social-distancing restrictions. The audience at the opening ceremony heard that, even after normality returned locally, the global supply chain disruption caused by COVID-19 further hampered construction.

The centre was largely complete by last year, but it remained unused because of repeated delays in getting its licences of occupancy.

The long-running saga was a major factor in the decision of four ministers, including former Health Minister Sabrina Turner, who attended the opening ceremony, to quit government.

MP McKeeva Bush used the occasion to launch a fresh attack on Turner over the delayed opening.

But she refused to rise to the bait and said only ""time will tell"" when asked to comment on Bush's onslaught.

She also released a statement that highlighted a ""myriad"" of troubles, such as electrical, plumbing and mould problems, and a leaking roof.

Turner added, ""The significance of this facility extends far beyond politics and its physical structure.

""It represents a commitment to bringing our Caymanian patients home, ensuring they have access to quality care and support in familiar surroundings.""

Seymour said earlier, ""The Poinciana Rehabilitation Centre stands as a symbol of our collective acknowledgment that mental health is, and always has been, a critical part of our overall health.""

Marcia Mullings-Thompson, the director of the new centre, told the gathering, ""This moment is a remarkable one for us at Poinciana Rehabilitation Centre.

""Though I have only awaited this since I arrived in 2023, my team and I are conscious that the wait has been much longer for Caymanians.""

She said the new centre, which will include education and training as well as psychiatric care, was designed to treat patients ""holistically"".

She said it was an environment ""in which the whole person, mind, body and spirit, is cared for"".",,million,,N/A,N/A,"Jamaica, East End"

supply chain disruption,We're on the brink of a world war and Britain is woefully underprepared,Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/brink-world-war-britain-woefully-192924622.html,"""The first duty of my Government is security and defence."" That was Keir Starmer in his first press conference as Prime Minister, the day after he took on the job.

Well, sorry Keir, but you've dropped the ball on this one. Because while Putin continues to wage war on the border of Europe with a seemingly endless supply of soldiers and kit, our Army is falling apart at the seams. Physically, emotionally and numerically.

Official figures, for example, show that in October, of the 181,550 people serving in the British Armed Forces in 2024, over half - or 75,674 personnel - were in the Army. The number of those who are fully trained and ready to go is just over 71,000. In reality though, says one insider, that's only about 67,000 people - because we also rely heavily on full-time reservists, who get rolled into the figures. Held strength in the field Army now stands at 83 per cent of capacity.

To put that all into context, Russian combat losses in the Ukrainian conflict thus far are estimated to be just over 700,000 troops, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The number of jobs that need to be filled, meanwhile, is 20-30 per cent higher than current staff levels - thanks in part to an expansion programme rolled out by the previous Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, when Putin first invaded Ukraine in February 2022. For every board that sits - to decide who goes where - about one in two jobs are filled. That means more reshuffling, moving people from one role to another earlier than planned, gaps where jobs remain unfilled for several months (meaning remaining personnel pick up the slack) and absolutely no give in the system whatsoever. Efforts are now in train to reduce roles, but that doesn't happen overnight.

And of course, this has a knock-on effect. The number of soldiers joining the Army is consistently lower than those making a hasty exit - and has been for several years. Those that are left have more and more work piled onto them. And in the meantime, the offer - what always used to make Army life, with its intense demands, antisocial hours and risk to life - worth it, is being ever more chipped away.

The Government's spiteful decision, for example, to implement 20 per cent VAT on private school fees, disproportionately affects military families, who get no exemption from the charge. The majority choose to send their children to boarding school out of necessity - Army jobs change about every two years and it's both difficult and stressful for children to have to switch schools every time. While taxpayer-funded support has been increased, the MoD was asked to eat into its own budget to fund the uplift and it has acknowledged that the increase will not cushion the full impact for many families.

The delayed new accommodation model, meanwhile - in which housing will no longer be allocated based on rank but on family size - is still happening, to the general dismay of those who are already hanging on by a thread. ""I already live two doors down from somebody I had to discipline for his behaviour recently - and my quarter's s--- as it is,"" one senior officer told me. ""If that's going to get worse, why would I stay?""

Perhaps the biggest problem, as she put it, is that ""we're becoming a really old Army, and we're going to have a black hole."" Those at the top of the pyramid are hanging on for the pension, the school fee assistance (such as it is) and with the end in sight - hoping that their marriages don't implode and their families fragment along the way. Those at the bottom start enthusiastically, but numbers dwindle. And there's a great big missing chunk in the middle.

One senior officer assessed the situation bluntly to me. ""The PM's got two choices,"" he said. ""Invest more money into more people, or keep it at fewer people and invest in modern kit. But it's Hobson's choice."" It takes time to work out which roles to cut, and time to transfer the load to what's left. And making decisions on spending takes longest of all. In the meantime, we have the MoD ""war-gaming"" a large conflict involving British troops, which will require military suppliers to demonstrate how they will increase production of critical weapons such as drones and missiles at short notice - and how the MoD can sustain personnel when faced with constant supply-chain disruption and intense fighting.

But while our fighting forces spend their time working out how, exactly, Britain would (or could) fight the World War that many argue has already begun, they are expected to wait for multiple consultations on ""guiding principles for a new strategy"", which may or may not (as Defence Secretary John Healey told the London Defence Conference last week) be published in spring - and that's before any sniff of a funding increase. Small wonder that increasing numbers of people are wondering whether to just call it quits.

The MoD is, at least, aware of the problem. It has just released a retention bonus of £8,000 - taxed - for people who have served for four years in exchange for signing on for an extra three: an attempt to stem the exodus from the middle.

But it feels like a sticking plaster on a wound that needs major surgery. If Keir Starmer really is serious about security and defence, he'll stop doling out money to unions and capitulating to the threat of strikes, and start focusing on those government employees who are allowed neither to unionise nor strike. Because they're the only ones who can both defend us and keep us safe.",,,,N/A,N/A,"MoD, Britain, Ukraine"
supply chain disruption,UN News Today 10 December 2024,UN News,https://news.un.org/en/audio/2024/12/1158016,"Syria crisis: nothing must stop peaceful transition, says UN Special Envoy

Just days since opposition forces including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept into Damascus and forced out President Bashar al-Assad, the top UN negotiator tasked with helping Syrians create a peaceful and democratic future, insisted on Tuesday that nothing can be taken for granted.

""Syria is now at a crossroads with great opportunities for us"", but also grave risks, ""and we need really to look at both,"" said Geir Pedersen, UN Special Envoy for Syria. He described HTS as the ""dominant"" force in Damascus today but said ""it's important also to remember that they are not the only armed group"" there.

A key potential sticking point to conducting international dialogue with the armed group is its terror listing by the Security Council - although this may be revised, Mr. Pedersen appeared to suggest:

""You have to look at the facts and to see what has happened during the last nine years. It is nine years since that resolution was adopted and the reality is so far is that the HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people; they have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness and frankly speaking, also we are also seeing in Aleppo and in Hama, we have also seen, you know, reassuring things on the ground.""

Amid images of jubilant scenes on the streets of Damascus following the end of the Assad regime, Mr. Pedersen welcomed reports that robberies and the ransacking of public buildings or private homes ""seems to have stopped"".

UN refugee agency sounds alarm after surge of arrivals in South Sudan

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has issued an alert after a surge of displaced people fleeing war-torn Sudan for South Sudan.

More than 20,000 crossed into South Sudan last week alone, UNHCR said, with the number of daily arrivals tripling, compared to previous weeks.

This includes South Sudanese refugees who have been leaving camps in Sudan's White Nile State where fighting between Government and opposition militia is continuing.

""The majority of those displaced are women and children,"" UNHCR said, as it underscored the impact of the conflict on vulnerable populations.

With more, here's UNHCR spokesperson Olga Sarrado, in Geneva:

""Of course, some of the people are leaving because of direct impacts by the violence, but others also, especially refugees, are telling us because of increased fears of how the situation can evolve in the next few days, our teams are on the ground. UNHCR and partners. But of course, the situation is extremely worrying in terms of humanitarian assistance.""

The UN agency reported people arriving at the main border crossing at Joda, but also at informal crossing points which are extremely difficult to access.

All of the new arrivals need life-saving humanitarian support, with water and healthcare the most urgent needs, especially given the ongoing cholera outbreak, UNHCR said.

Nissan is using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to digitalise its vehicle flow process from production forecasting to dealer stock management and customer sales.

The carmaker is working in a strategic partnership with Anaplan, a scenario planning and analysis platform provider, and aims to digitalise the car flow process by June 2025. It is the first stage in a wider project to use digital technology to enhance business optimisation with enhanced data accuracy across Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (Amieo) regions, according to the carmaker.

""This partnership marks a key acceleration point in Nissan's digitalisation journey and is an important step toward our mid-term plan, The Arc"", said Leon Dorssers, senior vice-president of region marketing and sales at Nissan Amieo.

Nissan launched The Arc business plan in March 2024 to increase electrification, bring in new approaches to engineering and manufacturing, including the adoption of new technologies and the use of strategic partnerships.

Nissan said the next stage in the digitalisation project would involve using advanced AI and ML technologies to deal with supply chain disruption, fluctuating costs and consumer demand patterns. The carmaker said it wants to speed up decision-making on production and resource allocation across the region. Nissan said it has partnered with Anaplan to strengthen its capability to analyse and understand longer-term market trends and forecast customer demand, inform design choices and optimise inventory management.

The Anaplan platform will be rolled out across Nissan's sales and marketing, supply chain management, manufacturing, logistics and finance functions. Nissan said it would integrate with legacy systems to ensure its operations across the Amieo regions are agile and responsive to the needs of customers.

Nissan is also focused on pushing digitalisation of operations in North America, as Gerardo de la Torre, regional senior director of supply chain management in the US and Mexico, made clear at this year's Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Digital Strategies North America conference. Last year Nissan named KPMG as its strategic partner for the Manufacturing Cybersecurity Supplier Program (MCSP) and is aiming for 80 supplier assessments by the end of this year.

Nissan also partnered with PwC to develop and launch its tier-n solicitation application, launched in June with plans for global adoption across the carmaker.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Mexico, US"
supply chain disruption,European Commission reveals new measures to support farmers,dpa-international.com,https://www.dpa-international.com/economics/urn:newsml:dpa.com:20090101:241210-99-288870/,"The European Commission decided on Tuesday to allow EU countries to pay out subsidies of up to €50,000 ($53,000) over three years to farmers without prior approval, alongside other measures to appease the bloc's angry agriculturalists.

Raising the limit from €25,000 intends to cut red tape and is designed to help farmers ""tackle inflationary pressure and high commodity prices,"" EU Competition and Climate Commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement.

The increased flexibility is the latest move based on the EU executive arm's talks with the agricultural sector after farmers demonstrated across the European Union against reduced incomes and burdensome bureaucracy.

The top EU competition watchdog said the payment changes are meant to recognize the ""exceptional sector-specific inflation"" in recent years in agriculture linked to energy costs and supply chain disruption.

In another support measure, the European Investment Bank (EIB) along with the commission announced a package of €3 billion in loans, targeted at young and new farmers, as well as female farmers, to boost investments in the EU's agricultural sector.

The Brussels authority also moved to strengthen farmers' positions in negotiations with retailers and wholesale suppliers.

This involves more stringent written contracts between farmers and their customers and a clearer market definition for what constitutes a fair price for products like milk.

The most important thing was that farmers get these contracts in writing as they are often verbal agreements, EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen told dpa in an interview.

Hansen said the problem was that verbal agreements cannot be legally enforced afterwards should someone fail to uphold their side of the deal.

To keep the contracts straightforward, farmers and their buyers should have ""the necessary freedom and simplicity to make them as simple as possible,"" Hansen said.

The European Parliament and EU countries will now examine these proposals. The EU agriculture commissioner expects little resistance and a swift approval of the measures.",,,,N/A,N/A,Brussels
supply chain disruption,Is the Worst Disruption Behind Us?,IndustryWeek,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/strategic-planning-execution/article/55248238/is-the-worst-disruption-behind-us,"You can build in operational resilience, even if you can't predict what's ahead.

For the past five years, we have possibly experienced the worst disruption in a long time. Between COVID, supply chain disruption, and inflation, it was a rough ride. Are you out of the severe turbulence area? Nobody knows for sure.

As a realist, I want to believe it is smooth sailing from here. But the last 10 years have taught us that more stuff is about to happen.

On the positive side, the last disruptions forced organizations to increase resilience and agility. Some companies did better through disruption and used the opportunity to go back to their core and focus on big bets. As Churchill would say, ""never let a good crisis go to waste.""

In reality, most companies were mostly reactive, struggled through COVID and are still feeling the aftershocks years later.

There is more disruption coming our way. Let us be honest with each other. Disruption never ends. What change is the intensity of the disruption and the nature of disruption.

For those of you who are new to the concept of disruption, it is defined as ""a disturbance or problems which interrupt an event, activity, or process"" (dictionary.com).

The key words in this definition are ""interrupt"" and ""activities."" Disruption interrupts businesses from accomplishing their core missions.

I propose three categories of disruption leadership teams should pay attention to:

1. Current disruption we are experiencing: We are in the middle of the firefight and in mitigation mode. In this category, it is too late to anticipate; you have to get in action and troubleshooting mode. Current disruptions include currency war, trade tariffs, geopolitical conflicts, piracy and cybersecurity risks. Hopefully, you are on top of things and ""cruising"" through the turbulence.

2. Future disruption we can anticipate: You could argue this is not true disruption according to the definition. But it might still radically impact your business processes and fundamentals. The key at this stage is that you do not have the solutions to the potential issues ahead. You are in introspection and analysis mode. You engage with experts, consultants, or scholars to create the solutions drawing from innovation, technology or business process improvement, for example. This is often called mega-trends analysis that is part of strategic innovation and risk management strategy.

So, what can we anticipate? Experts predict catastrophic climate events, severe scarcity of materials due to protectionism and conflicts, severe intentional disruption and sabotage of the internet infrastructure, and large-scale war. Anticipation is key. So is preparation and early mitigation.

3. Unpredictable disruption: COVID was not predictable. The medical community and the WHO (World Health Organization) mentioned the risk but never thought it would materialize. Well, it did. And it was bad for people and for business. It is impossible to prepare for unpredictable disruption. What is possible is to increase resilience and agility to be able to withstand any disruption.

Why is it that some companies resisted well and adapted quickly from the COVID crisis and others not? Why is it that some companies in the same industry had different performance levels during the inflation period? It is a question of strategy, culture and mindset. A company that is average to its core might not survive any disruption. There is no margin for error.

Managing and anticipating disruption is the new mindset of the future. That does not mean you have to become Mr. or Ms. Doomsday. It means you need pay attention, have your senses activated and escape from business as usual. This is called organizational mindfulness. It means that when the next bit crisis is coming, your organization is going to be better equipped to respond and react. It is all about being proactive and a bit less reactive. So -- ask yourself the following five questions:

Being proactive means creating internal mini-crises and make necessary changes without being forced to do them by disruptive events. So, in essence, it is about self-disruption to avoid being disrupted.

Trust me when I say this: change is the only constant. Disruption is coming. Will you be ready for it?",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

supply chain disruption,Airlines industry to strengthen profitability in 2025 amid supply disruption,The Star ,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/12/10/airlines-industry-to-strengthen-profitability-in-2025-amid-supply-disruption,"GENEVA: The global airlines industry is projected to strengthen its profitability in 2025 with a net profit of US$36.6 billion (RM161.8 billion), representing a 3.6 per cent net profit margin amid ongoing cost and supply chain disruption, said the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Meanwhile, total industry revenues are expected to be US$1.01 trillion (RM4.46 trillion), an increase of 4.4 per cent from 2024. This will top the US$1 trillion (RM4.42 trillion) mark for the first time.

IATA director-general Willie Walsh said the improvement will be hard earned as airlines take advantage of lower oil prices while keeping load factors above 83 per cent, tightly controlling costs, investing in decarbonisation and managing the return to more normal growth levels following the extraordinary pandemic recovery.

""All these efforts will help to mitigate several drags on profitability which are outside of airlines' control, namely persistent supply chain challenges, infrastructure deficiencies, onerous regulation and a rising tax burden,"" he said during IATA Media Global Day here.

The operating profit is expected to be US$67.5 billion (RM298.35 billion) for a net operating margin of 6.7 per cent, improved from 6.4 per cent expected in 2024.

The return on invested capital (ROIC) for the global industry is expected to be 6.8 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024's 6.6 per cent, with the strongest ROIC for airlines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.

IATA Sees Improvement in Asia-Pacific Profitability

IATA said all regions are expected to show improved financial performances and deliver a collective net profit in 2025 compared to 2024.

It said Asia Pacific's net profit is expected to be US$3.6 billion (RM15.91 billion), representing a 1.4 per cent net profit margin.

IATA noted that Asia Pacific is the largest market in terms of revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) with China accounting for over 40 per cent of the region's traffic.

In 2024, RPKs grew by 18.6 per cent, fuelled in part by market stimulus from visa requirement relaxations for entry to several countries including China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.

""Chinese carriers reported net losses in the first half of 2024 as a consequence of supply chain issues, oversupply in the domestic market and a limitation of 100 weekly frequencies from China to the United States.

""Asia Pacific has also experienced the sharpest drop in yields in 2024, thanks to strong demand and increasing load factors. A slight improvement in profitability is likely in 2025,"" said AITA.

For the longer term, Asia-Pacific International traffic is seen rising 5.6 per cent on average in 2023-2043, behind ASEAN's 6.1 per cent.

For next year, global passenger traffic is expected to grow 6.2 per cent to exceed the five billion mark for the first time to 5.2 billion.

Supply Chain Continues to Impact Airline Performance

IATA expects severe supply chain issues to continue to impact airline performance into 2025, raising costs and limiting growth.

Aircraft deliveries in 2025 are forecast to rise to 1,802, compared to estimated deliveries in 2024 of 1,254 aircraft.

This was well below earlier expectation for 2,293 deliveries with further downward revisions in 2025, it said.

The backlog for new aircraft has reached 17,000 planes, a record high.

""Supply chain issues are frustrating every airline with a triple whammy on revenues, costs, and environmental performance. Load factors are at record highs and there is no doubt that if we had more aircraft they could be profitably deployed, so our revenues are being compromised.

""Meanwhile, the aging fleet that airlines are using has higher maintenance costs, burns more fuel, and takes more capital to keep it flying. And, on top of this, leasing rates have risen more than interest rates as competition among airlines intensified the scramble to find every way possible to expand capacity,"" said Walsh.

He added that the airlines need to be fixing their battered post-pandemic balance sheets, but progress is effectively capped by supply chain issues that manufacturers need to resolve.

Walsh said persistent supply chain issues are at least partially responsible for two negative developments, namely, stagnant fuel efficiency and soaring aircraft leasing costs.

""The entire aviation sector is united in its commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But when it comes to the practicality of actually getting there, airlines are left bearing the biggest burden.

""The supply chain issues are a case in point. Manufacturers are letting down their airline customers and that is having a direct impact of slowing down airlines' efforts to limit their carbon emissions.

""If the aircraft and engine manufacturers could sort out their issues and keep their promises, we'd have a more fuel-efficient fleet in the air,"" said Walsh. - Bernama",,"billion, , , billion, billion",,N/A,N/A,"Malaysia, Thailand, China, the United States, Vietnam"
supply chain disruption,"'Bravo, MAGA': Trump can't promise that Americans won't pay more if tariffs are enacted | The Mary Sue",The Mary Sue,https://www.themarysue.com/bravo-maga-trump-cant-promise-that-americans-wont-pay-more-if-tariffs-are-enacted/,"Incoming president Donald Trump claimed during his Meet the Press interview that he's uncertain if tariffs would lower inflation. Nevertheless, he also says he's a ""big believer"" in tariffs.

Kristen Welker from NBC News asked Trump about the exorbitant tariffs he intends to place against three of the United States' largest trading partners. Welker reminds viewers that Trump's campaign promise has been to end inflation. ""Economists of all stripes say that ultimately, consumers pay the price of tariffs. Can you guarantee that American families won't pay more?"" Trump responded, ""I can't guarantee anything. I can't guarantee tomorrow, but I can say that if you look at pre-COVID, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. I had a lot of tariffs on a lot of different countries, but in particular, China. We had no inflation.""

Not everyone online was impressed by Trump's answer. One X user sarcastically wrote, ""Bravo, MAGA."" Voters largely chose Trump to alleviate rising costs in goods. They perceived Trump to be a better leader for the economy, despite economists warning that Trump's tariffs are likelier to worsen inflation. Additionally, businesses would either have to hoard imports or find alternative sources. Essentially, Americans will suffer the brunt of the supply chain disruption in the meantime.

Welker clarified to Trump that his first-term tariffs made the cost of washing machines and tires go up. Trump staunchly defended his decision to put tariffs in place at the time by referencing Whirlpool washing machines that are made in Ohio. The president-elect said that Representative Jim Jordan informed him that Whirlpool was ""going out of business."" By putting 50% tariffs on washing machines made in China and South Korea, Trump said the sales of Whirlpool and other American-made washing machines went ""through the roof.""

The answer from Trump does not dispute the fact that appliances soared in price during his first term at the White House. Consumers ultimately shouldered the cost of the steep rise in prices. Additionally, not all American-brand appliances or cars are produced in the United States. Even Whirlpool has several factories in Mexico that will be slapped with Trump's 25% tariff proposal. Given the president-elect's answer, expect hard times ahead.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Mexico, Ohio, the United States, China, South Korea, the United States'"
supply chain disruption,Management buyout completed at CTW Hardfacing - Business Link Magazine,Business Link Magazine,https://www.blmforum.net/mag/management-buyout-completed-at-ctw-hardfacing/,"A management buyout (MBO) has been completed at CTW Hardfacing.

Based in Sheffield and established in 1972, CTW Hardfacing provides long term wear resistant solutions to a wide range of industries, including those in the power generation, steel production, oil and gas and food processing sectors.

In a linked transaction, CTW Hardfacing also acquired the trade and assets of a larger supplier, which will further bolster the range of services offered by CTW Hardfacing.

The transaction was led by Jack Ware and Peter Wilmer of the Hawsons Corporate Finance team. BRM Solicitors (led by Rory Conwill) provided legal advice on the transaction.

NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland Invoice Finance supported the transaction with a funding package that included a term loan, a commercial mortgage and an invoice discounting facility. NatWest were advised by Clarion.

This is the second MBO that Hawsons Corporate Finance have completed for CTW Hardfacing. The first was back in 2018 where Mark Hill and Adrian Carr bought out former owner Ken Cooke, and this transaction was also led by Jack Ware and Peter Wilmer.

The purpose of the current MBO was for Adrian Carr to buyout his business partner Mark Hill to become the sole shareholder of the group.

Mark Hill said: ""I started my career here at 16 years old and have now served CTW for over 47 years in various manual and managerial roles.

""Six years ago the company founder Ken Cooke passed Adrian and I a great opportunity to take CTW on to its next chapter and during this time Adrian and I are proud to have achieved good growth through such unprecedented trading conditions such as Covid-19, Brexit and the supply chain disruption.

""I hope that Adrian and the wider team will continue to serve our clients well and help CTW move forward successfully for many years to come.

""My thanks go to Jack Ware at Hawsons, Rory Conwill at BRM Law and Clarions (acting for NatWest) who have all worked very well together to ensure this transaction was completed on time.""

Adrian Carr said: ""Firstly I would like to personally thank Mark, it has been an absolute pleasure working side by side with you over the last 7 years, we have gone through ups and downs within the business but we have always come out at the end smiling.

""We have pushed our limits to the highest standards to help set the foundations for CTW for many years ahead. I wish Mark a very happy retirement and wish you good health for the future.

""Also, I want to thank Rory Conwill at BRM, Jack Ware from Hawsons & NatWest for completing the transaction on time.""

Hawsons Corporate Finance Director, Jack Ware said: ""It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Adrian and Mark again following the MBO in 2018. CTW Hardfacing has gone from strength to strength since the MBO in 2018 increasing its turnover and profitability driven by the hard work of Adrian and Mark.

""I have every confidence that CTW Hardfacing will continue its success following this MBO. It has been a pleasure to work with all parties involved.""",,,,N/A,N/A,Sheffield
supply chain disruption,Global forest products facts and figures 2023 shows fall in global trade in wood and paper products,farming.co.uk,https://www.farming.co.uk/news/global-forest-products-facts-and-figures-2023-shows-fall-in-global-trade-in-wood-and-paper-products,"Global trade in wood and paper products dropped steeply from record levels in 2021 and 2022, with the paper trade continuing to decline under pressure from digital media, according to the latest data released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The Global forest products facts and figures 2023 report says the worldwide wood and paper products trade saw a significant drop of 12 percent: exports decreased by $64 billion to $482 billion in 2023.

This level was still above the highest international trade value ever seen before 2021. But significantly, the fact that trade value declined faster than traded quantities for most of the products indicates a drop in forest product prices in 2023 amid a general slowdown in economic growth.

Global production of paper and paperboard contracted by 3 percent, owing to a continuous replacement of printed media with digital products.

""What we have seen happening is a combination of factors, with production and trade declining due to global supply chain disruption, slowing consumer demand and trade restrictions, together with a longer-term decline for example in global paper production and trade along with the progress of digitalization,"" said Zhimin Wu, Director of FAO's Forestry Division.

Most categories show decline

Global production and trade of most major wood-based products recorded a decline in 2023 with only wood-based panels recording a marginal growth in production.

Industrial roundwood (used for any purpose other than energy and includes pulpwood, sawlogs and veneer logs, and wood used for fence posts and telephone or electricity poles) - In 2023, global industrial roundwood removals declined by 4 percent to 1.92 billion m³. Global trade decreased by 13 percent to 100 million m³ (the lowest level since 2009).

Sawnwood (including planks, sleepers or cross-ties, beams, joists, boards, rafters and lumber) - Production decreased in all five regions around the world in 2023. Global production of sawnwood contracted by 4 percent to 445 million m³ (the lowest since 2014), and the decline in international trade was as twice a big - 8 percent to 129 million m³ (the lowest since 2014).

Wood-based panels (plywood including blockboard and laminated veneer lumber, particle board, oriented strand board, and fibreboard) - Global wood-based panel production grew by just 1 percent to 381 million m³ (owing to increased production in the Asia-Pacific that offset a decrease in other regions). However, international trade in wood-based panels followed a downward trend similar to that of other products, falling by 7 percent to 84 million m³ (lowest since 2016).

Wood pulp - Global production of wood pulp declined by 2 percent to reach 193 million tonnes. In contrast, trade in wood pulp increased by 3 percent to reach a record level of 71 million tonnes.

Paper and paperboard - In 2023, production declined in Europe and northern America, while it stagnated in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. It grew only in Asia-Pacific. World paper production dropped by 3 percent to 401 million tonnes (trade by 7 percent to 104 million tonnes, the lowest since 2010). Global production of graphic papers declined by 9 percent while other paper and paperboard recorded a smaller decrease of 3 percent in 2023. Production of graphic papers in 2023 (84 million tonnes) was at the lowest level since 1987.

Wood pellet - Production has increased dramatically in the last decades, mainly owing to demand generated from bioenergy targets set by countries. However, the growth for the first time paused in 2023, recording a drop in production by 2 percent and trade by 5 percent. In 2023, global production reached 47 million tonnes.

Engineered wood products - The first ever published data on engineered wood products launched by FAO show that in 2023 global production of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) amounted to 4 million m³ (exports - 1 million m³), glue-laminated timber (glulam) - 7 million m³ (exports - 2 million m³), cross-laminated timber (CLT or X-lam) - 1 million m³ (exports - 0.6 million m³) and I-beams (I-joists) - 1 million tonnes (exports - 0.3 million tonnes).",,"billion, billion",,N/A,N/A,America

Like-for-like (LFL) revenue for its financial year ended 30 September declined by 3.2%, with the Pepco business witnessing a 2.8% fall despite improved performance during the year and positive LFL growth since September.

Poundland's LFL revenue fell 3.6%, while Dealz Poland saw a decline of 4.8%, impacted by clothing and GM transition to Pepco-sourced products.

Stephan Borchert, chief executive officer, said, ""At Poundland, recent performance has been very challenging, impacted by declines in clothing and general merchandise following the transition to Pepco-sourced product ranges at the start of the year.

""We are taking swift action to get Poundland's performance back on track, focusing on a return to Poundland's strengths. We will also closely evaluate Poundland's overall competitive positioning and requirements for future success as an FMCG-led format. We will provide further updates on Poundland during the first half of 2025.""

Group revenue amounted to €6.2 billion, registering double-digit growth of 10.2% compared to the previous financial year.

At Pepco, revenue increased by 14.2% during the year, while Poundland and Dealz Poland reported increases of 0.2% and 39.5%, respectively.

Andy Bond, non-executive chair, stated, ""We grew underlying EBITDA by a quarter to €944 million across the group, ahead of expectations, with a strong recovery in gross margin of almost 400 basis points, driven by the performance of our core Pepco brand.""

In September of this year, the group said its fourth-quarter underlying revenue was lower than the prior year, partly reflecting ongoing supply chain disruption.

Bond added, ""We started the year with a number of objectives which included rebuilding Pepco's profitability in its core Central and Eastern European (CEE) market, gross margin recovery, adopting a more disciplined approach to investment with more targeted growth, reviewing underperforming areas of the business, and delivering stronger cash generation.

""We have delivered on these objectives, but there remains more to achieve. As a result of renewed confidence in our future, we are announcing an inaugural full-year dividend for the group.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"Poundland, Pepco"

Innovation is central to Airbus operations in Wales. From the manufacturing line to the protection of data, the company's research and development innovations redefine what is possible in aerospace and in cyberspace.

Airbus's Broughton site is one of the most technologically advanced aircraft manufacturing plants in the world, which focuses on wings production.

New wings will play a key role in helping aviation achieve its net-zero goal, but there are difficulties to consider.

Posts 5 Broughton: the heart of wing production

The Broughton facility was originally created in 1939 as a shadow factory (a concealed WWII facility to protect and continue war production despite enemy bombings) to manufacture aircraft during the Second World War. It has since become one of Airbus's most important production centers.

This plant is involved in the production of wings for the whole family of Airbus commercial aircraft, such as the A320, A330, A350, and A380.

Situated over 700 acres and with a workforce of about 6,000, the Broughton plant is one of the largest in Wales. Wings manufactured here are shipped by Airbus Beluga aircraft to final assembly plants in Toulouse, Hamburg, and Seville. This process shows the strategic but intricate supply chain system that exists at Airbus.

Over the last couple of years, Airbus has invested heavily in increasing production capacity at Broughton. In 2022, the company stated that it wants to boost the A320 family production rate to 75 per month by 2025 . This expansion is expected to generate up to 450 new positions in the facility, thus an indication of the single-aisle aircraft market growth.

In addition, there has been a vast improvement in the technology in production lines. So, the production of wings has been enhanced by automation and digital manufacturing processes over the years.

Consequently, the economic impact of Broughton on the economy of Wales is large. According to UK parliament, Airbus has invested over £2 billion in Broughton in the last decade.

The company also has a very close relationship with local educational establishments to develop skills development and training schemes. This partnership ensures that there will be an adequate supply of human resources for the production line as well as the growth of the economy.

Also, in 2020, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbus transformed the Broughton research site into a production line of ventilators for the health sector, according to Forces News.

Fun fact: the Broughton FC, formed in 1946, is a Welsh football club known as 'The Wingmakers' . They use the Hollingsworth Group Stadium which is near Hawarden Airport and their floodlights are retractable because of the airport's proximity.

Newport: cybersecurity and digital innovation

Whereas Broughton is heavily involved in actual production, Newport is critical to Airbus's digital operations. Focusing on cybersecurity, the Newport site covers some of the biggest risks for the aviation and defense industries.

As the number of cyber threats increases with the aim of disrupting aerospace infrastructure, Airbus has taken measures to safeguard data, aircraft and communication channels.

Airbus set up a Cyber Innovation Hub in Newport in 2019. At the hub level, the organization collaborates with the Welsh Government and other UK defense establishments to build solutions for secure communication and encryption.

The 'Ectocryp' is one of the facility's leading inventions. It is used in government and defense communication and is believed to be the 21st-century equivalent of the Enigma machine.

Ectocryp is a range of Airbus cryptographic products designed to ensure secure voice, data, and video communications up to the UK 'Top Secret' level.

Newport is not simply a company asset for use exclusively by Airbus but also a valuable component of the United Kingdom's defense system.

Preserving significant aviation facilities and military indicators, the site serves the security of the country and demonstrates Wales as a cybersecurity sector leader.

Airbus is very sensitive to security matters in the cyber world, especially after what happened last year. In September 2023, it suffered a data breach that exposed the information of over 3,200 vendors, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, according to The Cyber Express.

The cyberattack began when a computer belonging to Turkish Airlines was infected with RedLine malware, possibly as a result of downloading a pirated Microsoft .NET framework; subsequently, the attackers were able to infiltrate Airbus systems using stolen login credentials.

Challenges and opportunities for Airbus in Wales

In November, the UK Government revealed plans to increase funding for the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) Programme by £975 million over the next five years to help drive innovation and produce jobs in the aerospace industry, which currently provides work for many people in North Wales, according to North Wales Live.

Moreover, £49 million has been earmarked for aerospace in Wales - the development of aircraft engines and helicopters and the strengthening of the UK's position as a world leader in wings and engines on the way to net-zero aviation.

According to UK Aviation News, Airbus also intended to establish a helicopter manufacturing plant in Broughton to assemble H175M helicopters, which the UK Ministry of Defence would use to replace aging Puma aircraft.

Nonetheless, in August 2024, Airbus pulled out of the race, arguing that it could not meet the Ministry's demands and achieve sustainable profitability of the proposed plant in the long run.

Still, there are many opportunities available. Airbus aims to maintain its delivery target of 770 aircraft despite supply chain hurdles and its efforts to develop the next generation of environmentally friendly aircraft. These challenges could provide Wales with an opportunity to continue to be the center of aircraft production for the next several decades.

Since governments and airlines are searching for solutions that are more environmentally friendly than the current aircraft, Airbus cannot avoid making changes in the production line.

Wales could be involved in this transition, especially if new wing designs or sustainable aviation technology are incorporated into the Broughton site.

However, to counter the problem of production halts during the COVID-19 outbreak, Airbus has come up with several mitigation strategies such as a more diverse supply chain, thus eliminating the risk of supply chain disruption.

Recently, the BBC reported that Airbus will cut 477 UK jobs as part of a plan to eliminate more than 2,000 positions worldwide by mid-2026 to improve efficiency and bring down costs in its space business.

The firm recorded a 22% profit drop to £1.8bn, with a 7% sales rise to £44.5bn due to supply chain issues in order fulfillment.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Broughton, UK, North Wales, the United Kingdom's, Hamburg, Seville, Newport, Wales, Toulouse"
supply chain disruption,Will AI Reboot Supply Chains?,Global Finance Magazine,https://gfmag.com/technology/ai-reboot-global-supply-chains-shipping-costs-regulation/,"Advanced technologies are being deployed to tackle mounting global disruptions in the urgent battle for resilience.

Catastrophic weather events, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade conflicts, global pandemics -- the forces disrupting supply chains are multiplying at a rate few could have anticipated.

Since Covid-19 swept the globe, risks have spiraled, forcing governments, industry groups, nongovernmental organizations, and corporate CEOs and CFOs to rethink supply networks from the ground up. And the current threats show no sign of slowing.

As global supply chains brace for escalating tariffs, rising shipping costs, and an expanding regulatory landscape, companies are scrambling to adapt to demands for greener, more-resilient networks. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are bringing new tools to bear, but the fundamental challenges and growing fragility of globalization will remain, experts tell Global Finance.

""We're certainly in a new era of global supply chains, but it's not that today's risks were entirely unseen before,"" says Tinglong Dai, professor of Operations Management and Business Analytics at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School.

Extreme weather has always been a threat, but its frequency and intensity are now unparalleled, Dai says. Similarly, risks such as the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping have increased.

""The real shift,"" Dai explains, ""is in our recognition that the global supply chain model of the past 30 years is no longer sustainable, especially in light of new geopolitical realities. The US can no longer count on a China-centric supply chain structure to operate smoothly. We're moving toward what I would call a 'Supply Chain Iron Curtain.'""

Rising Shipping Costs

""The world has very much changed, and the risks of global manufacturing and transportation have increased tremendously,"" says Zach Zacharia, associate professor of supply chain management and director of the Center for Supply Chain Research at Lehigh University's College of Business. ""The large shipping lines are all not going through the Red Sea, and again that has changed the cost and time required to transport goods.""

Events have forced companies to look more closely at shipping costs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine dealt a blow to globalization, Zacharia continues. Before, it made sense to produce something at the lowest cost and then efficiently transport it.

""However, once Ukraine was attacked and Covid happened, you had to look at not just producing it cheaply but transporting it back safely at a low cost, which became much more critical,"" he says.

""We do see more volatility in maritime supply chains,"" says Jan Hoffmann, head of trade logistics at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It hasn't helped that ""key chokepoints like the Suez and Panama canals are increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, conflicts and climate change,"" as UNCTAD states in its Review of Maritime Transport 2024, published in September.

Tariffs could soon be a complicating factor, as US President-elect Donald Trump has stated his intention to expand their use. Tariffs were a big issue in the recent US presidential campaign but are viewed by many as a lose-lose strategy. They don't really make sense, because tariffs invariably provoke retaliatory tariffs, cautions Zacharia. Still, they seem likely to proliferate in the current geopolitical climate.

""A surge in trade conflicts, and especially between the USA and China, is altering traditional trade flows between these leading trade partners,"" says Rouben Indjikian, a professor at Webster University in Geneva and former executive director of Global Commodities Forum at UNCTAD. One recent example: China gets soya beans from Brazil at the expense of its traditional supplier, the US.

Elsewhere, globalization itself has brought a certain amount of ""just-in-time fragility,"" says Evan Smith, co-founder and CEO at Altana AI. Boeing, for example, used to control most of the value chain in the manufacture of its aircraft. ""Today it's doing only the final assembly of its planes,"" says Smith.

This means that if there is an interruption, for whatever reason, in deliveries of parts such as seats and engines from one or more upstream suppliers, the entire production line may have to shut down, as happened to Boeing in July.

""This outsourced, ... efficiency-at-all-costs supply chain [favored by so many companies] is efficient only under conditions of stability,"" which is not what we have today, Smith explains.

Companies and organizations need to embrace a diversified strategy that includes reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring, says Dai. ""It's not just about bringing production back to the US. That alone won't shield companies from risks, particularly those driven by climate change,"" he argues. ""We need to diversify not only across regions within the US but also by collaborating with allies and neighboring countries.""

Some have already traversed this path. ""Apple has been quite successful in de-risking its global supply chain. They've built in significant optionality and resilience, taking concrete steps to reduce reliance on any single country or region,"" says Dai.

A 'Sea Change In Regulation'

For corporations, managing their supply chains could get more complex -- and expensive -- given the current global regulatory climate. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence directive is already in force for some companies, yet only 9% of respondents in McKinsey's 2024 Global Supply Chain Leader Survey say that their supply chains are currently compliant with the new rules, which impose human rights and environmental due diligence requirements on large EU companies and on large non-EU companies operating in the EU.

UNCTAD recognizes that ""rapid decarbonization is critical"" regarding global supply chains, yet ""the transition to greener ships and low carbon fuels is still in its early stages.""

""There has been a big sea change in regulation,"" comments Smith. Governments now insist that companies be aware of what is happening across their supply chains to a degree not seen before.

The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was signed into law at the end of 2021, requires companies to take steps to prevent forced labor in their supply chains. The US Customs and Border Protection agency requires that all companies whose supply chains draw upon China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have to undertake and document extensive ""due diligence measures to ensure compliance with US laws and trace their supply chains for potential exposure to forced labor.""

This isn't always easy. A large US apparel firm might know who is manufacturing its garments, and the origins of the textiles used in that process, but may not have knowledge about the cotton that goes into those textiles. Today the apparel firm must ensure that forced labor isn't being used to pick the cotton that will be spun and woven into textiles and fashioned into clothes that will appear on US retail store shelves, says Smith.

Can New Technologies Make A Difference?

In this increasingly volatile supply risk environment, how does a company or organization mitigate these risks? Can emerging technologies, particularly AI, provide support?

More companies are now tapping into giant supply chain datasets and using machine learning algorithms to apply predictive analytics, ""allowing for very fast decision-making and mitigation of supply risks before they arise,"" says Peter Liddell, Global Operations Center of Excellence lead and Global Sustainable Supply Chain lead at KPMG Services in Singapore.

""Embracing AI is a high priority right now for global supply chain leaders across all industries and all jurisdictions,"" he continues. In KPMG's 2024 CEO Outlook, which surveyed 1,325 CEOs surveyed worldwide, supply chain disruption was rated a top threat to business growth.

By comparison, supply chain risk ranked only fifth in KPMG's 2022 survey. Importantly, Liddell notes, ""64% of global CEOs surveyed indicated that they would invest in AI regardless of the economic conditions.""

Many organizations are already using AI-based tools to improve supply chain ""visibility""; that is, the ability to track and monitor the movement of products and information throughout the supply network. Of supply chain leaders surveyed in the McKinsey report, 55% said they were using AI for this purpose, making it the technology's most common use case. And this rate of AI usage backs up the increasing complexity of supply chains, as the survey also reports that ""the share of respondents who say that they have good visibility into deeper levels of the supply chain fell by seven percentage points, the second consecutive annual decline in this measure.""

Where AI could prove really useful, though, according to Shawn Fitzgerald, senior research director at a strategic consulting firm, is in developing ""what if"" scenarios.

Using AI-enhanced predictive analytics to ""game out"" scenarios beforehand can vastly improve logistics, Fitzgerald suggests. A manager would ask the algorithm, for example, whether it is safer and more efficient to transport goods by air or by water.

Sustainability is a growing concern of governments, and supply chains can expect to come under more pressure to ensure that they are part of the solution, not the problem. Tracking every step in the supply chain process could eventually be a corporate imperative. If so, DLT may prove a useful tool, according to Liddell.

""The ability offered by DLTs for data visibility, to trace every transaction, and to identify the actors involved can enhance the reliability and accuracy of product traceability and tracking, especially in times of greater geopolitical uncertainty and as concerns over trading partners begin to grow,"" says Liddell.

""Visibility and traceability are two critical requirements for supply chains to enable ESG Scope 3 reporting,"" he adds. Those reporting requirements are a part of the international corporate value chain standard and could boost the adoption of DLTs and of blockchain at scale.

What Can CFOs Do?

Are there concrete steps that all corporate CEOs and CFOs should be taking to make their supply chains safer, considering growing geopolitical risks?

Some supply chain leaders are creating strategies for the next five to 10 years, adopting a greenfield-planning approach, says Liddell -- that is, building models from scratch, with a clean slate.

Several organizations are also working on plans to fully automate the supply chain planning function -- 100% automation -- ""but this is likely to be far more difficult than many expect,"" Liddell comments.

""My view is that organizations want to better understand their own risks, their suppliers' risks, and their suppliers' suppliers' risks, and ask for mitigation plans, but have not significantly increased their own investments in risk mitigation,"" says Shawn Muma, director of supply chain innovation and emerging technologies at the Digital Supply Chain Institute, a research organization of the Center for Global Enterprise.

This is the case even as new AI/machine learning tools become available to optimize business decision-making, like optimal machine learning (OML), a process that can handle enormous amounts of past and current supply-and-demand data and make recommendations on such matters as ideal production quantities and the most efficient shipping arrangements, Muma adds.

Digital enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is gaining in popularity among CEOs and CFOs, Webster University's Indjikian says. ERP permits companies to make supply chain an integral part of the overall planning of production, transportation, and distribution of their goods.

But ERP and digitalization can go only so far. ""While digitalization can make early warning systems better, they cannot easily overcome geopolitical risks and especially climate events and their consequences,"" notes Indjikian.

""It's really mostly about diversification,"" says UNCTAD's Hoffmann. ""A shipper will try to depend on several carriers, routes, ports, modes of transport, and goods suppliers.""

Companies should also strive to avoid letting supply chains become too deep, with too many levels, leaving them dependent not only on their supplier, but also on the supplier of their supplier and so on.

Overall, supply chain management must be valued by corporate boards and top-level management as no longer a mere back office, logistics type of job, a matter of making sure that goods show up on time in the most cost-efficient way, Altana AI's Smith argues.

Companies will have to raise supply chain management to an executive-level priority, suggests Fitzgerald. They will need to hire and retain the right talent, invest in ongoing training, and ""ensure there is a career track for supply chain professionals to advance and partner with the business over time.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"USA, Geneva, Brazil, Zacharia, McKinsey, US, Panama, Singapore, Ukraine, Russia, Smith, China"
supply chain disruption,Mysterious outbreak in the DRC could imperil tech industry,theregister.com,https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/09/drc_disease/,"Is the industry ready to be tested if the unidentified deadly pathogen spreads beyond rural Kwango Province?

A mystery disease with a fatality rate higher than COVID-19 has broken out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and while the global pandemic risk is currently considered to be low, some of the world's biggest tech giants may want to dust off those pandemic supply chain disruption plans.

There have been 406 cases of the mysterious disease reported in the DRC's southwestern Kwango Province since October 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Sunday. Of the known infections, 31 people - mostly children - have died, giving the disease a case fatality ratio of 7.6 percent, seven times greater than the estimated 1 percent of COVID-19 infections that have proved fatal.

That estimate may be low, however. ""There have been several additional deaths outside of health facilities [that] still need to be investigated, characterized, and verified,"" the WHO noted.

Symptoms of the unidentified disease include fever, headache, cough, runny nose, and body aches, with victims in fatal cases also exhibiting difficulty breathing, anemia, and signs of acute malnutrition.

""Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and a number of associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles, and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor,"" the WHO said. ""Laboratory tests are under way to determine the exact cause. At this stage, it is also possible that more than one disease is contributing to the cases and deaths.""

The WHO reported that the outbreak region has experienced food insecurity in recent months, has low vaccination rates, and limited access to diagnostic tests and healthcare services. The rural and remote nature of the towns where infections have been reported has also made deploying experts a slow process. According to the WHO, reaching the area from the DRC's capital of Kinshasa takes 48 hours by road, and there's no functional laboratory in the province.

That's meant samples retrieved from patients have to be shipped back to the capital. To make matters worse, insecurity in the area means armed groups could disrupt the transport of medical experts and disease samples in and out of the region.

The rural and remote area where the outbreak is occurring is advantageous, in one sense, because it means the risk of it spreading to the rest of the DRC is somewhat limited.

""At the national level, the risk is considered moderate due to the localized nature of the outbreak,"" the WHO said. ""However, the potential for spread to neighboring areas, coupled with gaps in surveillance and response systems ... underscores the need for heightened preparedness.""

If the unknown disease manages to spread beyond the remote villages of Kwango Province, there's the risk it could end up disrupting supplies of critical minerals used in a variety of technology products.

The DRC's economy relies heavily on mineral mining. It's the world's largest producer of cobalt, a critical component of rechargeable batteries found in many electronics, and is often mined in unsafe and inhumane conditions that have led to criticism and legal issues for the tech industry in recent years.

Along with cobalt, the DRC is Africa's largest producer of copper and contains vast deposits of tin, tungsten, tantalum - also known as the ""three Ts"" - and gold. The US International Trade Administration estimates untapped mineral reserves in the DRC are worth as much as $24 trillion.

Even if the mysterious disease breaking out in southwestern DRC begins to spread, it could end up under control before it reaches mining operations in the DRC, which are mostly confined to the eastern side of the nation.

There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this situation. It's not clear whether this is a novel pathogen or something that's been identified in the past whose spread has been exacerbated by instability in Kwango, whether it has the potential to spread further, or if we're already past the worst of it. Reported cases peaked during the week of November 9, but new cases continue to emerge, according to the WHO.

We've been here before, staring down the barrel of a potential pandemic that disrupted supply chains all over the world. Even with the chance of regional or global spread currently considered low, it would behoove businesses whose supply chains could be disrupted for this reason or another to make some contingency plans before it's too late. ®",48 hours,,,N/A,N/A,"Kwango, Kinshasa, Congo, Kwango Province, the Democratic Republic of the"
supply chain disruption,Textile companies hog limelight on export prospects,@businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/textile-companies-hog-limelight-on-export-prospects/article68965572.ece,"Stocks of most textile companies rallied on hopes for better export prospects with the unrest in Bangladesh opening up fresh opportunities despite looming geopolitical concern and supply chain disruption.

Welspun Living was up six per cent at ₹174, while Himatsingka Seide and Gokuldas Exports increased eight per cent and six per cent to ₹211 and ₹1,037, respectively. Indo count Industries jumped 13 per cent to ₹387 each share.

Textiles exports increased 12 per cent in October to $1.83 billion from the year-ago period. Apparel exports registered 35 per cent year-on-year growth in October due to realignment of the global supply to India amid the prolonged unrest in Bangladesh.

Push from govt incentives

Backed by government incentives, some Indian exports have increased their market share in the US and have emerged as a preferred sourcing destination despite global headwinds and disruptions due to ongoing wars.

Dr Siddhartha Rajagopal, Executive Director, Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, said short-term gains are being reported due to the Bangladesh crisis, especially in the garment segment.

Some of the Christmas-season orders meant for Bangladesh seem to be coming India's way with home textiles exports also in positive territory. Overall demand trends are looking up and this fiscal will end on a positive note, he said.

FTA and festive season

Besides the Bangladesh crisis, textile exporters have also benefited from the free trade agreement (FTA) signed with countries like South Korea, Japan, Australia and Mauritius.

Ashutosh Somani, Executive Director, Institutional Equity Research, JM Financials said the global inventory de-stocking cycle has now come to an end, with Indian players expecting relatively better demand in the second half of this fiscal as retailers gear up for the holiday season.

With rising labour costs amidst the China-plus one theme playing out, China has been losing market share across the world with its share in UK alone falling to 19 per cent this year from 27 per cent in 2020, said Somani.

The internal turmoil in Bangladesh and high factor costs in Vietnam might play well for Indian exporters, he said.

Ongoing wars have disrupted the traditional trade routes adding to the cost burden and this is the appropriate time for the government to support this labour-intensive sector through hand-holding, capacity augmentation, skilling, investment and sustained financial support to this MSME-driven sector, said a textile company executive.

Tuesday's Global Dairy Trade closed a further 9.3 per cent lower, closely followed by today's Fonterra milk price of NZ$3.85 per kilogram of milk solids.

Fonterra's announcement, expected to pull $2.5 billion out of rural economies, is the lowest price since 2002, although advisers have stressed that costs have risen by over $1/kgMS since then and that farms are in twice as much debt.

According to DairyNZ, the Waikato area stands to lose out on $692 million and Canterbury on $494 million.

The 2015/16 season will be ""very difficult"", Fonterra chairman John Wilson said this week.

He blamed a continued imbalance in the global milk supplies for ""unsustainably low"" milk prices, which farmers around the world are ""increasingly grappling"".

The added complication of Russian trade restrictions, causing particular upset in Europe, has led to more dairy products being moved to intervention.

Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan extended Private Storage Aid for SMP and Butter, in a week seeing more supply chain disruption from protesting dairy farmers aggravated by processor price cuts.

The extension will run up to March 2016.

French farmer protests last month drove politicians to call on bank and supermarket cooperation.

Low prices across pork and dairy sectors resulted in transport blockades last month, resulting in the government negotiating deals with French banks to restructure farm lending and debt interest.

Farm groups in New Zealand have also agreed ""a few initiatives"" with banks to support farmers if and when help is needed.

DairyNZ, Fonterra and Federated Farmers have met with banking representatives this week, in a bid to ensure sufficient support for facility conversions for sharemilkers.

DairyNZ said: ""We need sharemilkers in our industry - they are our future - we have to wrap support around everybody working on farms"".

supply chain disruption,US supply chain disruptions continue,The Cattle Site,https://www.thecattlesite.com/news/55386/us-supply-chain-disruptions-continue,"US supply chain disruptions continue When workers essential to the food supply become ill, how does this affect the food supply chain within the meat industry?

When large meat processors are forced to close their doors due to employee sickness, the impact can be felt throughout the supply chain. Farmers who normally supply these markets are left with few options, often turning to small-scale meat processing operations, writes Michigan State Extension.

Many smaller processors are not equipped with the resources to absorb higher volumes of production. Limitations such as structural restrictions, fewer staff, limited capital and the lack of necessary equipment to operate such large volumes are often a challenge for smaller businesses. As a result, many livestock suppliers have nowhere to go with their livestock. Without an outlet for the supply, farmers may experience situations where alternative options are needed for their livestock.

With these considerations in mind, what viable options exist for livestock producers if they are unable to get their livestock to a processor?

Beef

Feedlot operators with contract cattle may be asked to hold cattle longer. In those situations, the following practices may be recommended:

Continue feeding finishing diet

Back down to a lower energy grower or maintenance diet

Depending on length of the supply chain disruption, feeder cattle might not be purchased due to a backlog of contract cattle and feeder markets may decrease. Deacon calves may also have a decreased market leading to the potential of euthanasia.

Dairy

Some farms may need to decrease milk production due to issues with milk hauling and processing as well as issues with on-farm labor. Drying off cattle early is an option that could reduce labor needs and decrease milk production. Farms could move from 3 X milking to 2 X milking of all cows to reduce production or consider a combination of 2 X and 3 X milking where low production cows are dropped down to 2 X milking.

To reduce feed consumption and lower milk production, consider drying off late lactation animals early. Furthermore, work with your nutritionist to take out some high cost energy items in your ration.

Check with the stockyards to confirm if regular schedules are still being followed. Follow the Fit for Transport Guide from the American Association of Bovine Practitioners as animals will most likely be transported farther distances during this time. When a cow is suffering from a disease or injury, the humane choice is to euthanize on-farm rather than send her on a long trailer ride. Where possible, hold healthy cull cows until you can sell them and check your feed inventory to make sure you have enough feed for the cull cows. Lastly, consider drying them and putting them on a low-cost diet like a dry cow, heifer ration or pasture.

Swine

It is times like this, that packer arrangements and established relationships are proven valuable. Consideration can be given to slow the gains of hogs in late finishing by 25 - 30% or from 2.2 pounds per day to 1.7 pounds per day by feeding less energy-dense diets (less than 1,470 kcal ME/lb.) and less essential amino acids (0.1 or 0.15 less the SID lysine recommendation; keeping other ratios the same).

Attempting to stop growth in hogs is discouraged as this will compromise animal health and carcass quality. Slowing growth, however, will gain a producer a couple of weeks of ""holding"" time in the finishing barn. Farms with lower hog numbers can potentially slow growth for a longer period of time, resulting in very heavy carcasses.

Additional variable costs in holding hogs will likely be greater than the returns. There may also be a need for additional finishing space in the production system when holding hogs longer. During warmer weather, the use of a hoop-barn, open-fronted barns and other older facilities could be options to accommodate the need to hold hogs longer than normal.

Producers should communicate with and make non-traditional arrangements with their current packers to determine if they might need to look for other packers or butchers. This may mean staging delivery and accepting the price that is offered. This might also mean heavy hogs being sold in the sow market. In drastic situations, backed-up flow in the production system, may require:

Small Ruminants

Market lambs and cull sheep are currently seeing a reduction at market and auctions. Fewer buyers mean reduced prices. Consider maintenance diets instead of finishing diets by feeding a lower concentrate/higher forage diet. Moreover, be sure ram lambs are castrated. If inexpensive feed is available, consider holding culls until the market opens.

In goat dairies, consider feeding milk to buck kids to sell as meat kids in the fall and consider culling the least productive animals as the cull market is currently in good shape. Additional information can be found by contacting a member of the MSU Extension small ruminant team.

MSU Extension recognizes that one option which may be necessary is the euthanasia of some animals. The second article in this series, Planning tool for welfare culling during farm disrupted operations; describes humane, on-farm euthanasia practices, while the third article, In times of supply chain disruption, how do I appropriately dispose of my livestock mortalities? discusses proper mortality management.

In November 2024, the company announced Omnipod 5's compatibility with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus CGM sensor in the United States. The company has also fully launched the Omnipod 5 iOS app in the United States. Earlier to that, the company announced the full market release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the United States. Insulet noted that, G7 customers have started to consistently meet the company's target. Further, Omnipod DASH is driving strong new customer starts in the U.S. type 2 diabetes market.

The second one focuses on delivering consumer-focused innovation. In the third quarter of 2024, the FDA cleared Omnipod 5 for use by people with type 2 diabetes (aged 18 years and above), expanding the technology to nearly 6 million insulin-requiring people in the United States. This year, the company will expand on the Omnipod 5 platform by bringing new sensor integrations, launching the system in new geographies, and extending the phone control offering.

High Potential in Underpenetrated Diabetes Market: Approximately 40% of the Type 1 diabetes population in the United States and even less of the international type 1 diabetes population use insulin pump therapy. Furthermore, an even smaller portion of the U.S. and international insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes population use insulin pump therapy. The combined patient population using either intensive insulin therapy or basal insulin is roughly three times the size of the type 1 population. These factors, therefore, present a significant available market for its Omnipod platform globally. Overall, Insulet sees massive market opportunities, both in furthering type 1 MDI penetration as well as the type 2 market.

Strong Solvency but Leveraged Balance Sheet: Insulet exited the third quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $903 million and current debt of $42 million. This robust financial stability appears highly promising, especially during the prolonged period of macroeconomic issues. Long-term debt of $1.36 billion remained marginally in line with the 2024 second-quarter figure. Debt-to-capital stood at 55.6X at the quarter end, indicating a highly leveraged balance sheet despite a 5.6% sequential improvement. Meanwhile, times interest earned improved 0.4% sequentially to 8.3X.

Concerns for Insulet

Economic Uncertainty Hampers Growth: The continuing worldwide macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty may reduce demand for Insulet's products, intensify competition, exert pressure on prices, dent supply, and lengthen the sales cycle. The company faces challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruption, while its sole reliance on third-party suppliers, especially in China, could face potential risks from political or financial instability and labor unrest, among others. We are particularly cautious as growth could moderate further if the economic scenario worsens. While expanding into new markets with Omnipod 5, the company must navigate the impact of currency fluctuations on its financial performance.

Sole Reliance on Omnipod System: Insulet's financial results continue to largely depend on the performance of its lead product -- Omnipod System. Per the company, any adverse changes in the market acceptance of the product or worsening of the factors that negatively influence the sale will dent the company's financials majorly.

PODD Stock Estimate Trend

supply chain disruption,MBO at engineering business builds foundations for the future | TheBusinessDesk.com,The UK,https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/2132575-mbo-at-engineering-business-builds-foundations-for-the-future,"A management buyout has been completed at Sheffield-based CTW Hardfacing.

The company, which was established in 1972, provides long-term wear resistant solutions to a range of industries, including those in the power generation, steel production, oil and gas and food processing sectors.

In a linked transaction, CTW Hardfacing also acquired the trade and assets of a larger supplier, which will further bolster the range of services it offers.

The deal was led by Jack Ware and Peter Wilmer of the Hawsons Corporate Finance team.

BRM Solicitors, led by Rory Conwill, provided legal advice. NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland Invoice Finance supported the transaction with a funding package that included a term loan, a commercial mortgage and an invoice discounting facility. NatWest was advised by Clarion.

This is the second MBO Hawsons Corporate Finance has completed for CTW Hardfacing.

The first was in 2018 where Mark Hill and Adrian Carr bought out former owner Ken Cooke, and this transaction was also led by Jack Ware and Peter Wilmer. The purpose of the current MBO was for Adrian Carr to buyout his business partner Mark Hill to become the sole shareholder of the group.

Hill said: "" I started my career here at 16 years old and have now served CTW for over 47 years in various manual and managerial roles.

""Six years ago the company founder Ken Cooke passed Adrian and I a great opportunity to take CTW on to its next chapter and during this time Adrian and I are proud to have achieved good growth through such unprecedented trading conditions such as Covid-19, Brexit and the supply chain disruption.

""I hope Adrian and the wider team will continue to serve our clients well and help CTW move forward successfully for many years to come.

""My thanks go to Jack Ware at Hawsons, Rory Conwill at BRM Law and Clarions (acting for NatWest) who have all worked very well together to ensure this transaction was completed on time.""

Carr said: ""Firstly I would like to personally thank Mark, it has been an absolute pleasure working side by side with him over the last seven years, we have gone through ups and downs within the business but we have always come out at the end smiling.

""We have pushed our limits to the highest standards to help set the foundations for CTW for many years ahead. I wish Mark a very happy retirement.

""Also, I want to thank Rory Conwill at BRM, Jack Ware from Hawsons & NatWest for completing the transaction on time.""

Hawsons Corporate finance director, Ware, said: ""It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Adrian and Mark again following the MBO in 2018.

""CTW Hardfacing has gone from strength-to-strength since the MBO in 2018 increasing its turnover and profitability driven by the hard work of Adrian and Mark.

""I have every confidence CTW Hardfacing will continue its success following this MBO. It has been a pleasure to work with all parties involved.""

Conwill, corporate director at BRM, added: ""My colleagues and I are very pleased to have supported Adrian and Mark on this transaction.

supply chain disruption,Will South Korea's Political Crisis Affect the Chip Market?,Analytics India Magazine,https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-insights-analysis/will-south-koreas-political-crisis-affect-the-chip-market/,"With political unrest in South Korea, which has the world's third-largest semiconductor manufacturing facility after China and Taiwan, the country is staring at a supply chain disruption.

The country holds a dominant position in the DRAM and NAND flash memory market, and companies like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have a substantial share in this space.

President Yoon Suk Yeol, declared emergency martial law last week, only to revoke it within hours. His future remains uncertain even as he survived the impeachment motion.

South Korea accounted for 17.7% of the global semiconductor market in 2022, according to the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), a public policy think tank. Nearly two-thirds of the country's semiconductor exports are to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam.

The East Asian country is known for producing semiconductors smaller than 10 nm, holding 37% of the world's production capacity.

""Should current political challenges escalate, they could disrupt operations and supply chains, triggering a cascading impact on the production and export of semiconductors, memory chips, and other critical components,"" said Prabhu Ram, VP, of Industry Research Group at CyberMedia Research, to AIM.

Investment banking company UBS noted that the market impact tends to be short-lived and the AI supply chain has disproportionately more exposure to Taiwan than South Korea despite the latter being home to key suppliers of HBM chips.

""We estimate that about 50-60% of big tech's AI capex is focused on Taiwan, and about 5-10% on South Korea,"" UBS noted in its recent report.

The semiconductor landscape is evolving rapidly, and with competing nations accelerating their advancements in semiconductor capabilities, the global competition is intensifying by the day.

The government policies are also conducive to the growth of the semiconductor industry in South Korea. The 'K-Semiconductor Strategy' launched by the government in 2021, aimed to attract $450 billion in investments by 2030 and enhance semiconductor production capabilities.

As of 2024, its semiconductor market was valued at $2.8 billion and is expected to grow to $2.9 billion in 2025 and over $4 billion in 2033.

As a manufacturer of fabless firms, Samsung ranks second-largest globally after TSMC. Meanwhile, according to reports, SK Hynix, a leading manufacturer of AI memory chips, is slated to deliver sixth-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, based on 3nm process technology, to Nvidia later next year.

On the AI front, South Korea has been making significant progress. This year, Rebellions, a fabless AI chip startup, raised $124 million in a Series B round, bringing their total funding to $210 million.

Companies in the region are also partnering with big tech companies such as Microsoft. Korean Telecom (KT) Corporation and Microsoft have signed a multibillion-dollar, five-year AI partnership. KT will provide $450 million in network and data centre infrastructure over 15 years while both companies will invest in AI and cloud technologies to advance AI services in South Korea.

South Korea's semiconductor industry has been influenced by U.S. and China tradeoffs in the past. Recently, the US imposed new export restrictions on 140 Chinese companies that target advanced memory chips and chipmaking tools. The Western nation has been asking South Korea to adopt similar curbs.

The US government's sanctions stem from the anticipated threat of China using advanced semiconductor and AI systems for military modernisation and human rights concerns.

In response, China has also introduced export control on critical minerals for semiconductor manufacturing, like gallium and germanium, which could affect South Korean companies' operations. The banned materials are widely used in semiconductors, weapons, and electric vehicles.",,"billion, billion, billion, billion, million, million, million",,N/A,N/A,"U.S., Taiwan, Nvidia, US, China, South Korea, South Korea's, Vietnam, Hong Kong"
supply chain disruption,Indian Navy commissions stealth guided missile frigate INS Tushil in Russia,Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,https://newsable.asianetnews.com/india-defence/indian-navy-commissions-stealth-guided-missile-frigate-ins-tushil-in-russia-dmn-so80hd,"New Delhi: Indian Navy on Monday commissioned the multi-role stealth guided missile frigate -- INS Tushil at Kaliningrad in Russia.

The frigate was commissioned by India's defence minister Rajnath Singh and Indian Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi.

Know in details about INS Tushil:--

Built at Russia's Kaliningrad-based Yantra Shipyard, the INS Tushil is the first of two frigates that the Indian defence ministry inked an inter-governmental agreement with Russia in October 2016. This is a follow-on of the Talwar-class vessels.

INS Tushil, a 125 metre, 3900-ton ship, has a lethal punch and with a blend of Russian and Indian cutting edge technologies.

The ship's name, Tushil, means 'the protector shield' and its crest represents the 'Abhedya Kavacham' (impenetrable shield).

Along with its motto, 'Nirbhay, Abhedya aur Balsheel' (Fearless, Indomitable, Resolute), ""the ship stands as a symbol of the Indian Navy's undying commitment to protect and safeguard the nation's maritime frontiers,"" Indian Navy PRO Captain Vivek Madhwal said.

INS Tushil, an upgraded Krivak III class frigates of the Project 1135.6 of which, six are already in service - three Talwar class ships, built at Baltiysky shipyard, St. Petersburg, and three follow-on Teg class ships, built at Yantar shipyard, Kaliningrad. INS Tushil, the seventh in the series.

Now, the INS Tushil will join the 'Sword Arm' of the Indian Navy, the Western Fleet, under the Western Naval Command and will rank amongst the most technologically advanced frigates in the world.

Initially, the frigate was slated for delivery at the end of 2022, but it got delayed due to the global Covid-19 crisis, payment issues between the two countries, and supply chain disruption caused due to ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Indian original equipment manufacturers involved in the construction of INS Tushil:---

The ship has 26 per cent of indigenous content and the number of made-in-India systems have more than doubled to 33.

BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited, Bharat Electronics Limited, Keltron, Nova Integrated Systems from Tata, Elcome Marine, Johnson Controls India among others are the major Indian OEMs involved in the construction of the ship.

""It will not only be a symbol of Indian Navy's growing capabilities, but also the resilient collaborative strength of the India-Russia partnership.""

Rajnath Singh, who is on a 3-day visit to Russia, is also scheduled to call on Russian President Vladimir Putin and co-chair the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC M&MTC) meeting with his Russian counterpart, Defence Minister Andrei Belousov on Tuesday.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, New Delhi, St. Petersburg, Russia, Ukraine"
supply chain disruption,Australia: Large-scale solar PV capital costs fall for second year running,PV Tech,https://www.pv-tech.org/australia-large-scale-solar-pv-capital-costs-fall-for-second-year-running/,"CSIRO said that due to supply chain disruption and freight costs following the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022-23 editions of the report observed an average 20% increase in technology costs. In the 2023-24 edition of GenCost, there has been a general decrease in capital costs for key enabling technologies for the energy transition, solar PV and energy storage.

Large-scale solar PV has fallen 8% for the second consecutive year, whereas large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) costs improved the most in 2024-25, falling by 20%.

The levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for variable renewable energy generation technologies are now the lowest of all new-build technologies in 2024 and 2030, with the cost range overlapping with the lower cost range for coal and gas generation.

This provides another boost to large-scale solar PV, which, according to the think tank Climate Change Authority, has previously been identified as the fastest technology to deploy in the net zero race.

The Climate Change Authority report details that development can take two to three years for utility-scale solar PV projects, with construction taking an average of one and a half years. A rooftop solar PV system can be installed in two to three days.

With this in mind, solar PV is the quickest renewable energy generation technology that can be developed in Australia at the time of reporting. Onshore wind, for instance, has an average development phase of around three to five years, with construction taking two and a half years. Offshore wind has an average development timeframe of over seven years, with construction taking six years.

For utility-scale BESS, development can take an average of one to two years for a one or two-hour duration system, with construction taking one and a half to two years.

Another interesting finding within the report correlates to the use of nuclear energy in Australia, something that is currently banned but has become a focal point for the impending federal election next year.

According to the GenCost report, CSIRO has said that modelling nuclear's long operational life factor across all new-build electricity generation technologies presents ""no unique cost advantage over other technologies"".

CSIRO chief energy economist and GenCost lead author Paul Graham said the draft report found no unique cost advantage in nuclear technology.

""Similar cost savings can be achieved with shorter-lived technologies, including renewables, even when accounting for the need to build them twice,"" Graham said. ""The lack of an economic advantage is due to the substantial nuclear re-investment costs required to achieve long operational life.""

The draft report found GenCost's previous analysis of nuclear's capacity factor range of 53% to 89% fair and remains unaltered based on verifiable data and consideration of Australia's unique electricity generation sector.

The report indicates that global median nuclear construction times have risen from 6 years to 8.2 years over the past five years, resulting in a total development timeframe of approximately 12 to 17 years. Based on this analysis, GenCost has determined that the total lead time for nuclear development in Australia will be at least 15 years.",,,,N/A,N/A,Australia
supply chain disruption,2025 Aerospace and Defense M&A Outlook: Key Trends and Challenges for Dealmaking,Lexology,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=97cae9c5-888c-4a30-9b03-c1e40f45e713,"How A&D dealmakers can meet growing demand and facilitate M&A amid regulatory uncertainty, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, and technological advancements.

The year ahead looks promising for aerospace and defense (A&D) dealmaking activity -- but that doesn't mean there won't be turbulence.

Despite a muted 2024 for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector (see figure 1), strong fundamentals remain intact going into 2025. Global air-passenger traffic has rebounded from pandemic lows and is expected to grow nearly 12 percent this year. Defense spending continues to increase amid regional conflicts and pressure on NATO countries to hit 2 percent GDP spending targets. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom, meanwhile, is ready for liftoff as A&D executives strive to improve supply chain visibility, drive cost efficiencies, create revenue growth opportunities, and more.

Yet challenges remain, from labor shortages and ongoing inflationary woes to supply chain disruption and regulatory hurdles to uncertainties associated with policy changes following the recent US elections -- not to mention a heightened competitive landscape. As a larger number of buyers compete for limited assets at elevated valuations, their ability to perform extensive due diligence may be limited, emphasizing the need for experienced M&A counsel.

Here's what A&D dealmakers need to know heading into 2025.

Important trends that will impact M&A in the year to come include:

HIGH DEMAND, FRAGILE PROFITABILITY

As noted above, demand across various A&D segments remained robust in 2024 even amid macroeconomic headwinds. But that doesn't necessarily equate to increased profitability. This state of play could drive deal activity in 2025.

In commercial aerospace, high operating costs, parts shortages, and inflationary pressures are tightening margins and making profitability an ongoing challenge, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers are restricted in their ability to pass on higher costs to airline operators. These operators are saddled with similar challenges, as evinced by Spirit Airlines recently filing for bankruptcy protection.

In defense, organizations are impacted by similar challenges, though significant spending is being directed toward replenishing depleted stockpiles of munitions and expanding the defense industrial base (DIB). Meanwhile, there is continued demand for investments in modernization and advanced technologies; however, these efforts are hampered by budgetary constraints -- spurring the need for affordable and resilient proliferated systems, adoption of off-the-shelf commercial solutions, and more nontraditional supplier participation in the DIB.

SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS

In commercial aerospace, supply chain challenges, coupled with parts and skilled labor shortages, have tempered deliveries of aircraft, hindered production ramp-up efforts, and extended maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) turnaround times and backlogs. These delays are causing operators to defer retirement of aging commercial fleets, favorably impacting demand for MRO services and aftermarket parts.

In defense, companies are reshaping their supply chains as countries look to secure strategic capabilities, manage risk, and support production demand via onshoring and ""friendshoring."" This involves, for instance, the ongoing decoupling from China as rare earth mineral bottlenecks affect electronics and semiconductor production.

LABOR SHORTAGES

Attraction and retention of talent in A&D engineering, automation, and cybersecurity is a top priority for executives, according to a recent survey. Nearly one-third of the industry's workforce is over fifty-five years old, and the broader tech sector continues to draw talent away from A&D. Companies are increasingly looking to acquisitions to help fill these gaps.

In commercial aerospace, disruption from the recently ended machinist strike at Boeing and the concessions granted will percolate to the entire supply base. As Cai von Rumohr, an aviation analyst at financial services firm TD Cowen, told the Associated Press, suppliers that were working ahead of Boeing's schedule when the strike began may have since had to lay workers off or finance operations on their own. Boeing itself is rumored to be selling parts of its space business and raising billions through new stock or debt financing.

In defense, the FT reported earlier this year that there is an ""unprecedented"" scramble for defense industry workers as global military spending hits record highs. Major players are looking to add nearly 40,000 positions -- about 10 percent of their collective workforce.

TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION

In commercial aerospace, there is a heightened focus on operationalizing innovative technologies like AI and automation to drive advancements in sustainment practices; increase productivity and cost effectiveness; improve supply chain visibility, quality, and reliability; and access new revenue growth opportunities.

Investments in the advanced air mobility (AAM) sector are burgeoning amid increased urbanization and additional regulatory clarity from the Federal Aviation Administration. There will also be continued investments in other new markets and applications, like cloud technologies, predictive maintenance, digitalization of airports, and location-based services for supply chain management.

In defense, evolving national security needs are driving tech-enabled innovation in new capabilities (AI, data processing, etc.) and encouraging new entrants like Anduril, Palantir, and Shield AI into the DIB.

SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES

In commercial aerospace, the commitment to deliver net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 is promoting new market entrants and cross-sector collaboration. Regulations are also supporting this shift, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates in the European Union and the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits to SAF producers in the US (though the latter will expire at the end of the year and may not be renewed).

In defense, new programs designed to demonstrate and validate sustainable technologies used in operational and training environments are being deployed, such as the Department of Defense's Sustainable Technology Evaluation and Demonstration (STED) Program.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND UNCERTAINTY

M&A in the A&D space comes under intense regulatory scrutiny, from issues arising with government contracts and antitrust to national security considerations and specialized due diligence. Policy changes from the recent administration change in the US may also generate new uncertainties.

In commercial aerospace, some commentators suggest that the new administration's policy shift toward deregulation may roll back constraints on industry consolidation.

In defense, legislation like the CHIPS Act and Defense Production Act has aimed to address DIB vulnerabilities, facilitate supply chain diversification, and enhance resilience. However, ubiquitous continuing resolutions (i.e., temporary spending bills) continue to disrupt funding, increase uncertainty, and impair the ability to control costs and make timely investments.

The impact of proposed policy shifts by the new administration -- increased tariffs, a more isolationist stance, modernization priorities, and support for defense spending hikes amid unsustainable federal debt levels -- will present new uncertainties.

A&D M&A Outlook

As noted, M&A in the sector of late has been subdued amid elevated interest rates, uncertainty over policy changes, and mounting regulatory scrutiny. Current activity is driven mostly by the middle-market -- with acquirers focused on addressing strategic technology, capability, and talent gaps -- and sell-side transactions largely stemming from undercapitalized owner-managed businesses and the need to realign capabilities with evolving market priorities.

While these transactions largely avoid the regulatory scrutiny imposed on bigger deals, valuations remain high as earnings have stayed resilient (see figure 2 for valuation multiples by key segments). Areas of strong recent M&A activity include:

Commercial aerospace: Primarily in MRO and machined parts segments.

Defense: Most activity is generated by strategic buyers. Declines in Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (C4ISR) transactions are partially offset by increases in defense electronics and satellite and space systems segments.

Government services: Activity is focused on select specialized areas, IT businesses aligned to system modernization, intelligence, and security solutions -- as well as cybersecurity and training and simulation services across commercial aerospace, defense, and medical markets driven by technological advances (e.g., augmented and virtual reality).

The year ahead is promising for M&A for a variety of reasons:

Macro tailwinds: Deregulation, especially in areas like AI and antitrust -- as well as broader factors like lower interest rates, pent-up demand from business owners and operators to monetize their assets, and near-record amounts of capital raised by private equity (PE) firms -- is expected to spur M&A activity.

Commercial aerospace: Record order books will drive production expansion, but continued labor and supply side challenges could stifle growth. Expect vertical integration, the pursuit of efficiency enabling technologies, and cross-sector partnerships involving innovative technologies (e.g., AI in predictive maintenance and flight simulation software, autonomous systems, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), biometrics in airport security and passenger processing, sustainability, and technologies).

Defense: Although US increases in defense spending are currently capped at 1 percent, we should see supplemental spending jumps on near-peer deterrents and innovative technologies (e.g., AI, autonomous systems, Internet of Military Things (IoMT), augmented and virtual reality).

Government services: Despite continued consolidation, the sector remains highly fragmented. Specialty businesses with capabilities aligned to system modernization, critical mission support, security solutions, cybersecurity, and training and simulation sectors should offer attractive investment opportunities.

Underlying motivations for M&A will remain intact as the financing environment stabilizes: Strategics are expected to pursue portfolio reshaping, divest non-core assets, and seek acquisitions to access attractive technologies. PE firms are expected to exit investments held beyond typical holding periods and deploy near-record amounts of capital.

Middle-market deals are expected to dominate M&A activity as founders follow their business' natural lifecycle, access capital to drive growth, and pursue consolidation to drive scale, among other personal/financial considerations.

Long-term growth is also on the horizon. The global M&A market size in A&D is projected to reach USD 341 billion by 2029 (2024: USD 195 billion), climbing at a CAGR of 11.86 percent.

Strategic Considerations

Given this lay of the land, what should A&D dealmakers keep top of mind as they head into 2025? Here are a few key factors:",,,,N/A,N/A,"China, US"
supply chain disruption,Implementing Supplier Segmentation for Better Management and Financial Control,supplychainbrain.com,https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40666-implementing-supplier-segmentation-for-better-management-and-financial-control,"The proper management of supplier relationships is key to maintaining efficiency and driving success for your manufacturing business. It requires vigilance, collaboration, and time -- that last item a rarity across all industrial sectors.

Supplier segmentation is the process of placing suppliers into specific groups. While unique to each manufacturer, it has a common framework that, when used with the right tools, can help manage suppliers more efficiently, reduce risk, and maintain stronger financial control.

Too many manufacturers treat suppliers interchangeably. In reality, each supplier has unique strengths in addressing specific needs, such as parts manufacturing or staffing agencies.

Not all suppliers deliver the same levels of service. Some will prove to be more efficient than others, provide better customer service, or offer better discounts or pricing packages. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each supplier is critical for long-term success.

Segmenting suppliers brings multiple benefits. Firstly, by breaking suppliers into specified categories, a business can uncover greater supply chain insights and see if there are risks, such as too much dependency on a single supplier for a critical component or ingredient.

Secondly, you can identify consistently reliable suppliers by segmenting based on performance. Such a metric extends to quality, timeliness and maybe even the ability to get you out of a pinch. With studies attributing $82 million in annual losses due to supply chain disruption, the value of segmentation in helping to identify reliable partners and reduce shipment delays becomes clear.

To make supplier segmentation work, you first need an effective strategy. It starts with the gathering and analysis of data. Factors to consider include delivery time, price, payment history and geographic location of each supplier.

It's equally important to consider qualitative data. Is the supplier reliable? Does it communicate effectively? Is a given relationship likely to become more important in future? Incorporate all information impacting the end-to-end process, from initial transactions to strategic initiatives.

Of course, data alone isn't sufficient. You need the right tools to unpack your data into usable insights. Modern supplier analytics platforms help to centralize information for quick access to comprehensive information.

Some tools utilize artificial intelligence to predict supplier and supply chain trends. AI can utilize qualitative and external information to make predictions about how, for example, the rainfall in Panama might impact the Panama Canal, or whether increasing international tensions will impact trade routes and tariffs.

Setting Objectives and Goals

Segmenting without objectives won't get you very far. At the start of your strategy, allot some time to introspection. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of your current dealings with suppliers. How can segmentation help to strengthen your approach?

As with setting any targets in your organization, it's important to follow the SMART framework. This means that your segmentation objectives should be:

As an element of Lean Six Sigma initiatives, SMART goals are a proven method. If your goal, say, is to increase your on-time, in-full (OTIF) order percentage, you need to have a realistic number to aim for. The SMART goal technique will increase your odds of achieving it.

Aligning Segmentation With Business Strategy

You've identified a clear set of goals. But which forms of segmentation can help you to reach them?

Think of a business looking to improve its OTIF percentage. In this instance, it makes sense to segment suppliers based on their delivery performance metric, as it directly impacts yours.

Of course, you don't have to segment based on just one metric. You can apply further segmentations to your data to create more granular results.

For example, a small manufacturing business will likely want to balance costs and risk factors. As such, it would need to pull more specific and relevant reports from its accounting and operations management software to further segment the data, and find a supplier that meets its long-term financial and reputational needs.\

Creating a Segmentation Matrix

A segmentation matrix helps you to categorize suppliers into different groups. The best example is the Kraljic matrix, named after academic and author Peter Kraljic. Monitoring this model can help you assign supplier scorecards more effectively. The model plots value versus spend and splits suppliers into four different quadrants:

This segmentation model will not be applicable to every business. Think about your company's unique needs and objectives. Consider how you can apply them to your segmentation matrix.

Communicating With Suppliers

The importance of supplier communication cannot be overstated. Yet many manufacturers struggle to build a strong rapport with their numerous suppliers. This can lead to miscommunication around order quantities, delivery dates and other key areas. It also increases the chances of disputes emerging, which further damages relationships and can impact cash flow.

Communication should be a key part of your segmentation strategy. One example is to use a sentiment analysis tool to analyze previous communications. This can identify whether the language used was positive, negative or neutral. By segmenting based on positive communications, you can identify suppliers with a history of positive dialogue with your organization.

You should also collaborate with your purchasing and operations leaders for further feedback. Additionally, exploring negative communications could help in fixing a potential issue before it gets worse.

Response rate is another useful area to consider. In the ever-moving world of business, swift response times are critical. Are suppliers getting back to you quickly, or leaving you hanging for a response? Segmenting based on response times can help you prioritize efficient communication.

Segmentation shouldn't apply only to existing suppliers. Consider using your supplier segmentation criteria when choosing new suppliers. Examples might include segmentation based on:

Monitoring Progress against KPIs

Recall the ""M"" in SMART: it stands for ""measurable"". It's important to assign a key set of metrics to assess progress toward your goals. Following are some of the key performance indicators that can be useful in supplier segmentation.

Reviewing and Adjusting Segmentation

Your approach to segmentation shouldn't be static. Business needs and priorities change over time. As they do, it's important to bring your segmentation in line with your updated strategic objectives.

Review your segmentation efforts regularly. Consider how you can alter your tactics to produce accurate and effective segments. Are you tracking the right areas? Are segments based on sufficiently detailed data to provide you with accurate insights? Are you tracking the correct metrics to monitor your progress?

The management of supplier relationships is a team effort, and worth the time investment. With the proper tools at hand, supplier segmentation can reduce risk, and in the long term save the company time.",,million,,N/A,N/A,Panama
supply chain disruption,"Thar Coal, once touted as the end to reliance on LNG, is capable of producing its own natural gas. What will it take? - Profit by Pakistan Today",Profit by Pakistan Today,https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/12/09/thar-coal-once-touted-as-the-end-to-reliance-on-lng-is-capable-of-producing-its-own-natural-gas-what-will-it-take/,"When the first Thar Plant went live in 2019, it was supposed to reduce Pakistan's reliance on imported gas. What does it mean if Thar's Lignite can be gassified?

On a hot April afternoon in 2019, Pakistan fired up its first ever power plant fueled by domestic coal. The shiny new plant, run by the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, was the sort of project bureaucrats, politicians, and development sector flunkies dream about and doodle the name of in their secret diaries.

For starters, it was the first to exploit the 175 billion tonnes of lignite that was spread across the 900 km2 coal fields in Tharparkar, which is possibly the second largest coal reserve in the world.

Check.

The project was being run through a public-private partnership between the Sindh Government and Engro Corporation, which is by far one of the most responsible organisations in corporate Pakistan.

Double check.

And the real kicker? Engro's Thar Project came under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor with $50 billion of proposed investment in infrastructure projects. At the time this was one of the most talked about projects in terms of how China's Belt and Road Initiative was impacting the global energy landscape.

The Thar Coal fields had first been discovered in 1991 through a joint mission (we used that term very liberally) of the Pakistan Geological Survey and the United States Agency for International Development. With an estimated 175 billion tonnes of lignite, the Thar Coal Fields have the capacity to produce 100,000 MW of electricity for the next 200 years.

To put that into perspective, as of now the largest coal reserves in the world exist in the USA with just under 250 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.

The opportunity to exploit the coal fields was massive. The world was becoming wiser to the dangers of fossil fuels by the 1990s, but energy consumption still operated like the Wild West. But developing Thar Coal would take time, money, and a lot of technical assistance. And in the time between 1991 and 2019, Pakistan's energy mix became a mess. Up until the 1990s, the largest source of electricity in Pakistan was hydel. But as demand for power grew and the desire to make new dams evaporated, the government increasingly began relying on imports.

In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, these imports came in the form of furnace oil used by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). From 2013 onwards, Pakistan was relying on importing coal for the coal plants set up by the third Nawaz Administration in Punjab, as well as allowing the private sector to import LNG.

Of course there was a problem with this. Imported sources of fuel tend to get expensive, especially when you do not have a strong export oriented economy. Energy prices in Pakistan were dependent on the whims and stability of the international market and the global order. So much so that by the time Engro's plant went live in 2019, it was S&P Global reported on it with the headline ""Pakistan's Thar wager pits coal against LNG in its power mix.""

Thar Coal was supposed to be the answer to Pakistan's reliance on LNG and other imported sources of fuel. At least to some extent. While it was not clean fuel, it was cheap, domestic, and readily available. The idea was that you would set up more plants close to Thar and figure out how to transport coal to other regions. However, as time has proven, transporting Thar Coal and setting up power plants in the Thar region is not the easiest task in the world. And for many years now, one fantasy has persisted somewhere in the collective hive-mind of our policymakers: turning Thar Coal into gas that can feed our thermal power plants and replace the crippling need for LNG.

Now, a recent study has indicated this can be done in an economically feasible way. However, it is not the first time the government has tried to cash in on the concept of turning Thar's Lignite into gas. And it did not go very well the first time around.

The potential of Thar Coal

It is a simple problem. Pakistan relies heavily on imported fuel sources such as reliquified natural gas (RLNG) to produce electricity. Whenever there is an international crisis, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Pakistan's energy sector is rocked by the ripple effect. There is a simple solution. Cheaper fuel -- something like coal perhaps. And the source is right there too. Spread over more than 9000 km2, the Thar coal fields are one of the largest deposits of lignite coal in the world -- with an estimated 175 billion tonnes of coal that according to some could solve Pakistan's energy woes for, not decades, but centuries to come.

Currently, Pakistan produces around 2600 MW of electricity through Thar Coal. Just over five years ago, this figure was zero. The total reserves from Thar Coal are more than the combined oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Iran. The reserves are around 68 times higher than Pakistan's total gas reserves. Compared to this potential the current utilisation of Thar Coal in the total power generation mix is around 10% which means that there is huge opportunity to expand in this sphere.

But as of now, imported fuel continues to be a big force in Pakistan's electricity mix. What matters is that we are currently in a situation where we are dependent on RLNG. When RLNG was introduced into Pakistan's energy mix, it was relatively cheaper and also environmentally friendlier than coal. Although long-term agreements with Qatar still provide gas at a relatively affordable rate, the spot market is a blood bath. Pakistan has been turning more and more to the spot market to address the growing local demand for gas.

The average cost of gas is rising at a very rapid pace due to the Ukraine war and subsequent global supply chain disruption. It is an issue Profit has covered in the past. During the Nawaz administration, the government decided to increase the generation capacity cheaply at the risk of it getting expensive later, which it has now. By 2022, the increased reliance on both imported coal and LNG, Pakistan was generating just over 52% of its electricity from purely domestic sources. That was down from 84% in 2005, and 71% as recently as 2012. This made Pakistan's market more vulnerable to the whims of the international market. This has only gotten worse. According to data from NEPRA, thermal power plants running on imported fuels accounted for roughly 62% of Pakistan's generation capacity in fiscal year 2022-23, with fuel costs alone representing an overwhelming 83% of the total generation expense. This heavy reliance on imports leaves the nation's energy security at the mercy of global markets and exchange rates, an increasingly untenable position as the Pakistani rupee continues to slide against the U.S. dollar. Efforts to mitigate these costs, such as allowing coal imports from Afghanistan, have been undercut by the dollar-based payment system, negating any potential savings.

However, when it comes to the use of Thar Coal, there are some possibilities. The proportion of imported coal in the generation mix declined in FY 2022-23 as compared to FY 2021-22, owing to the introduction of more plants utilizing locally sourced coal, including ThalNova Power Thar (Pvt.) Limited, Thar Energy Limited, and Thar Coal Block-I Power Generation Company (Pvt.) Limited, facilitated by Shanghai Electric. In the case of recently commissioned Thar Coal power plants, the availability of the transmission line was delayed.

At the same time the country's indigenous energy resources -- hydropower, local coal, wind, and solar -- remain underdeveloped or face significant production declines. These dependencies, coupled with a weakening currency and rising global interest rates, are driving electricity costs to unsustainable levels for a country already burdened by economic instability.

Shifting to domestic

Now, those that have gone all in on Thar Coal will tell you it is the solution to all of Pakistan's electricity problems. The difference in the cost of producing electricity from domestic coal and imported coal is substantial. The cost of producing electricity from the Engro plant, which uses domestic Thar coal, is Rs 10.44/kWh, whereas the Lucky Electric plant which uses the same type of coal (lignite) but imports it costs Rs 20.92/kWh, according to data from Nepra's latest monthly fuel cost adjustment report.

But the Lucky Plant has failed to gain access to Thar Coal. In a recent state of the industry report, NEPRA claimed challenges remain.

Currently, the local coal-based power plants rely on coal from Block-I and Block-II of Thar Coal. The development of Block-II has progressed through its envisioned three phases, but financial closure for Phase-III is still pending. Notably, Lucky Electric Power's 660 MW project, primarily a Thar Coal based project, operates on a blend of Thar Coal and Imported Coal due to delayed Thar Coal supply.

You have a situation where the requirement is to have more coal plants that can produce electricity through the lignite that is available in Thar, and you need to find cheap ways of transporting it. This challenge has persisted, and even though Thar Coal has come a long way in the past decade, one dream that has remained in the backdrop is the idea to turn coal into gas.

Turning coal into gas

Let us start by getting one thing straight, this is yet another pipe-dream that the government of Pakistan has. They believe that if Thar Coal can be converted into gas in an economically feasible way, they will be able to transport this gas through an extensive network of pipelines and provide it to all kinds of gas consumers. It will essentially be a replacement for expensive and volatile LNG and will do the same job. Almost like discovering new gas reserves.

Of course, this huge network of pipelines does not exist. There is no gas pipeline in Thar currently, and all of this infrastructure will have to be built. But what if they can pull it off? Coal gasification is a process that transforms coal into synthetic natural gas.

Coal gasification and liquefaction technologies have been around since the 18th century. Their supporters argue that they are relatively less harmful to the environment than directly burning coal for energy. Their critics allege that these technologies have massive capital and operational costs and are too complex to operate smoothly.

It is a scientifically doable process, but not all kinds of coal have the composition to be turned into gas in an economically feasible manner. The process is simple enough. Coal is pulverized and mixed with an oxidant, such as steam, air, or oxygen, in a gasifier vessel at high temperatures and pressures. This process creates syngas. The syngas is cooled and cleaned to remove impurities like sulfur, mercury, and particulate matter. The syngas is separated into streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is cleaned and ready for use. The carbon dioxide is captured and sequestered. Not only is this method possible, it is also cleaner than burning coal. The cleaned syngas can be burned in a gas turbine to generate electricity. At the same time, the hydrogen byproduct of the process can be used to make ammonia, fertilizer, or refine oil.

But can Thar's lignite be turned into gas? The question was first seriously addressed in 2013, when Pakistan hosted an international conference on coal. One result of this was a gasification project led by Dr Samar Mubarakmand. It was supposed to turn in its findings around 2016, but by 2018 there had been no headway. In fact, in the five years this project had been operational, the government managed to produce exactly 8MW of electricity from coal gasification after spending Rs 3.4 billion.

Now, this is not necessarily an amount that would not be worth it. The SC and other bodies often see figures like this and think they point to corruption. How can you only produce 8MW of electricity in Rs 3.4 billion? The answer is, if the purpose was to prove that Thar Cola can be used to efficiently make gas that can be burned into electricity, then the research and development costs of these projects can be much higher as well, and with no guarantee of a good result. But the issue obviously became a huge kerfuffle.

And in case you have not guessed it, in October 2018 the Chief Justice was the Honourable Justice (Thankfully Retired) Saqib Nisar. He very quickly directed the prosecutor general National Accountability Bureau to investigate Dr Mubarakmand and other officials for producing only 8MW electricity despite spending Rs 3.4 billion on the project.

Remember, there were no irregularities here. Dr Samar Mubarakmand, had conceived the idea of generating 100MW electricity through underground coal gasification. The science and technology department of the Planning Commission had approved the project for 100MW electricity to be generated through the UCG. Its cost was Rs 9 billion and was scheduled to be completed within two years.

Clearly this did not happen. In five years only 8MW were produced at a cost of Rs 3.4 billion. However, the project faced many delays. After digging through the receipts, Profit discovered that the project was launched in October 2012. For the first year-and-a-half, the project went into hibernation. It finally got up and running when the planning commission's science department released Rs 90 crore. Later, Rs 1 billion was released in 2013-14 and Rs 1 billion for the project were released in 2014-15. The project was then transferred to the energy department of the planning commission, which released Rs 36 crores and then completely stopped funding in 2016-17. So by the time Saqib Nisar got around to wagging his honourable finger at Dr Mubarkamand, the project had been out of commission for a couple of years. On top of this, it had also been passed around within the planning commission.

Obviously annoyed that NAB was knocking on his door, said that he only gave technical inputs on the Thar coal gasification project through research and he did not have any financial powers. Once again, this is how experimental projects work. But after this, the Thar coal-to-gas dream seemed to be dead in its tracks.

Could it still be done?

That is until last month. In early November, new study, conducted by a group of energy experts led by Dr Farid Malik claimed that gas produced from Thar coal would be cheaper than the imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and could help reduce the price of fuel and electricity for residential and commercial users. Dr Malik, an energy and technology management expert who is currently an adviser to the Sindh government, said the evaluations and laboratory tests conducted by Nelson Mandela University, South Africa, found that Thar coal was suitable for gasification. He estimated that the Thar coal gasification could reduce gas prices in Pakistan by 30 to 60%.

The price of imported LNG was fluctuating between $14-20 per mmBtu at that point, and this new study claimed that the gas produced from Thar Coal could be as low as $7-8 per mmBtu.

It is worth mentioning that this is a very flamboyant statement with no substantial working behind it. Many things have been assumed to come to this point, and the details of the calculation have not been shared. It is definitely posturing, and the reality will clearly be quite different. But the fact is that if it is even a little lower than the price of imported LNG, Pakistan will be able to at least have stability when it comes to energy prices rather than being dependent on the fluctuations of the market. And as far as the possibility of pulling this off is concerned, the test results show that Thar coal has an ash content of around 18pc and an ash flow temperature range of around 1,325°C, which makes it suitable for gasification. The carbon reactivity is also high, which is typical of lignite coal. The expected pure gas yield is between 1,550-1,600 cubic metres per tonne.

So does that mean the initial effort by Dr Mubarkmand had gotten something wrong? Well, the running explanation of the new study is that the technology required for coal gasification has gotten better at breakneck speed. Dr Malik attributed this to the increasing trend of countries like Germany moving towards hydrogen energy from coal gasification, which has made gasifiers cheaper.

As a result of the study, the Sindh Coal Authority is striving to woo private investment to finance the country's first coal-to-gas project to initially produce 100mmcfd to 200mmcfd of gas from coal in the Thar desert. This is already an improvement from the 2013 experiment, when the planning commission made the effort a public service project. The private investment required to buy around 20 gasifiers and get this thing up and running is around $10 million, as claimed by Dr Malik.

There are plenty of opportunities here. For starters, Engro is already involved in Thar Coal through the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company. It might make sense for Engro particularly because they are also in the fertiliser industry, and one of the byproducts of turning coal into gas is the production of fertiliser. The project would produce both electricity and fertiliser.

""We intend to buy 20 gasifiers, small modular plants each with a capacity to produce 10 million British thermal units (mmBtu) of syngas, from a source in Europe for this project."" Dr Malik said in an earlier comment given to the media. His plan is to buy two-decade old gasifiers from Europe, where they are upgrading their machinery on a very large scale. These second-hand gasifiers, which can work on Thar's lignite as proven in the South Africa based study, will then be used to make this initial gas from the Lignite.

The fertiliser equation

One of the big angles here is the idea of making integrated production facilities that will make both fertilisers and synthetic gas. Pakistan's fertiliser industry is already in a bit of a tough spot because of the lack of cheap or subsidised gas, which is necessary for its manufacturing. At the beginning of this year, the government under the direction of the IMF had begun a process to rationalise gas prices, including to industries.

There is a reason the IMF wants to increase gas prices in Pakistan. Very briefly put, Pakistan does not have a lot of gas but we use it like we do. The IMF, as part of the ongoing programme, wanted to increase the price of gas for all domestic and commercial consumers. You see, Pakistanis have gas cross subsidised. This means that the natural gas we produce is given to different consumers at different rates. There is one category of protected consumers which get it at the cheapest possible rate. These are small domestic consumers that use gas below a certain amount and tandoors that make rotis. Even within this protected category there are slabs and everyone is charged differently based on how much they consume. Essentially, bigger consumers end up subsidising smaller consumers. While this is a people friendly policy and popular for political decision makers, it is also unproductive.

Commercial connection rates were raised by 136%, and the biggest increase was in the cement sector which saw a hike of around 193%. Meanwhile the fertiliser industry saw a gas price hike of 175% as well this year. The subsidy of Rs 39 billion on feed and fuel gas for Engro Fertilisers was withdrawn and the ECC approved a new rate of Rs1,597 per mmbtu.

Dr. Malik outlines two potential approaches to coal gasification: converting coal into synthetic gas (syngas) to produce fertilizers directly at an integrated plant near the mining site, or transforming coal into syngas and further into synthetic natural gas (SNG) for distribution through an extensive pipeline network.

He emphasizes that the primary focus of authorities is leveraging the Thar coal gasification project to boost fertilizer production by encouraging investment in integrated urea manufacturing plants. ""We are currently facing a shortfall of 2-3 million tonnes of urea due to dwindling gas supplies for fertilizer production, forcing us to rely on imports,"" Dr. Malik explains. ""Prioritizing the first approach is essential for ensuring food security.""

But a problem continues here. The plan to turn Thar's lignite into coal is still a pipedream. All we know for sure is that in some world, theoretically, it can be done. It is possible and even feasible. The government definitely does not have the money to pursue this, which is why they are looking for investors. But gasification is already a tainted project. If Dr Samar Mubarkamand, a celebrated scientist who was a researcher not an investor, can be hounded by NAB and summoned to court for not getting results, why would investors have the confidence to jump into this project? It is something Dr Malik has admitted, telling Dawn in an interview last month that ""The business environment in the country is pretty hostile. Then, we have a big import lobby working against this project.""",,"billion, , , million",,N/A,N/A,"the United States Agency for International Development, USA, Saudi Arabia, U.S., South Africa, Qatar, Tharparkar, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, Germany, China, Iran"

The nation's fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

""These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,"" Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That's because ""once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,"" according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

Proactive Measures

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

Seek Supply Chain Alternatives

""Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump''s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

""Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,"" she pointed out.

Stockpile Inventory

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,"" Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

Diversify

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,"" he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,"" Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

Manage Financial Impact

""Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,"" Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

Plan Ahead

""Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,"" he commented.

Challenges

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

""A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn't changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,"" the report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

""The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,"" according to the survey results.

Fewer Discussions

""Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,"" the report pointed out.

""If you're not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you're flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,"" Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,"" advised in an email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

""At the end of the day, this isn't just about tariffs. It's about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It's about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously -- invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships -- will not just weather the storm; they'll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,"" he commented.

Evolve

""Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,"" Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Curtis and Maloy get green light in House,Daily Herald,https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/2024/dec/07/bills-sponsored-by-reps-curtis-and-maloy-get-green-light-in-house/,"Spenser Heaps for Utah News DispatchThe Colorado River is pictured near Moab on Sunday, Feb. 18, 2024.

Utahns in Congress are seeing some success during the U.S. House of Representatives' lame-duck session.

On Tuesday, the House passed two bills sponsored by Rep. Celeste Maloy and two bills sponsored by Rep. John Curtis, both Republicans.

From transferring several plots of federal land to state control, to putting more federal dollars behind water quality projects in the Colorado River, here's a breakdown of what the bills do.

The House on Tuesday passed Curtis' Colorado River Salinity Control Fix Act, which will put more federal funds behind efforts to reduce salinity in the lower Colorado River basin.

If the bill passes the Senate, the federal government will shoulder the burden of expenses for projects related to reducing salinity. Federal dollars would amount to at least 70% of funds spent on salinity mitigation and in some cases, 100% of operation and maintenance costs.

Most of the salinity in the river basin comes from existing rock formations. Precipitation breaks down the salts, carrying them into streams and eventually the Colorado River. Higher salinity levels limit what crops farmers can grow, reduces crop yields, damages riparian areas and harms the aquatic ecosystem of the river.

Congress passed the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act in 1974, which directed the U.S. Department of Interior to create a salinity control program for the entire Colorado River basin. For example, in one stretch of Colorado's Dolores River along the Utah border, rock formations deposit about 150,000 tons of salt into the basin each year. A U.S. Bureau of Reclamation project works to take that salt and inject it underground.

But with Colorado River flows declining and salinity increasing, Curtis said the act needed a facelift so the federal government could chip in more for projects spearheaded by local water conservancy districts and use local or state funds.

""The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the West, and its health is crucial for our communities, our economy, and our environment,"" Curtis said in a statement. ""The Colorado River Salinity Control Fix Act builds on decades of collaborative efforts to reduce salinity levels, which have greatly improved water quality across the Basin.""

Also passed on Tuesday was a bill sponsored by Maloy, titled The Utah State Parks Adjustment Act. The bill would put several parcels of federally controlled land in and around three Utah State Parks under Utah control.

The bill would convey three parcels of land (currently under the purview of the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service) to Utah to be included as part of Antelope Island State Park, Wasatch Mountain State Park, and Fremont Indian State Park. It would require Utah to use the lands for public purposes, including parks, campgrounds, recreation and permitted livestock grazing.

All of these parcels are either in holdings or located directly next to existing Utah State Park boundaries, according to Maloy's office, which included maps of the proposed land transfers in a news release.

""Utah State Parks, managed by Utahns with a deep knowledge of the land, are well cared for and maintained,"" Maloy said in a prepared statement. ""However, having federal lands interspersed throughout these parks has made effective management more challenging. I'm pleased to see the House pass the Utah State Parks Adjustment Act, returning these land parcels to state control.""

The Senate has yet to consider the legislation, though Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has introduced a companion bill. He issued a statement Tuesday calling the House's passage of Maloy's bill ""an encouraging win for all Utahns"" that ""demonstrates what we can accomplish when local voices are at the forefront.""

""I look forward to advancing this bill in the Senate to return these parcels to state control, streamline land management, and empower Utahns to steward the lands they know and love,"" Lee said.

Another bill sponsored by Curtis passed the House on Tuesday -- the Recognizing the Importance of Critical Minerals in Healthcare Act, which amends the Energy Act of 2020.

Now, the Secretary of the Interior will be required to consult the Secretary of Health and Human Services when designating critical minerals, elements, substances and materials.

The federal government defines a critical mineral as something that has ""a high risk of supply chain disruption"" and ""serves an essential function in one or more energy technologies, including technologies that produce, transmit, store, and conserve energy.""

Now, with the Department of Health and Human Services looped into these designations, Curtis says the country's health care system will be better suited to avoid potential disruptions.

""By including the Department of Health and Human Services in decisions about critical minerals, we can make sure essential medical technologies -- like MRIs -- are never at risk of shortages,"" he said in a statement.

The House on Tuesday also passed a bill sponsored by Maloy and Curtis, HR 8666, which would authorize more federal case locations in Moab and Monticello, rural areas in southeastern Utah.

Today, the Central Division of the District of Utah within the U.S. District Court has existing court locations including in Ogden, Salt Lake City, Provo and St. George.

""Residents of Southeast Utah called to federal jury duty are regularly excused due to hardship because the travel requirement is so unwieldy,"" the Judicial Conference of the United States wrote in a July letter expressing support for the bill. ""The addition of Moab and Monticello as places of holding court will provide the district flexibility to fashion solutions to service its remote areas, including the option to adopt a jury plan that would make jury service less burdensome for residents.""

The changes proposed by the bill would also come at no cost, according to the Judicial Conference, noting ""the district has agreements with state/county courthouses in Moab and Monticello for the use of their facilities at no cost.""

""Without this bill authorizing court proceedings in Moab and Monticello, southeastern Utahns must drive several hours to appear before a federal judge or serve jury duty,"" Maloy said in a prepared statement. ""I'm glad the House passed this bill allowing the Central Division of the District of Utah to hold court in these rural areas, which would save Utahns time and money.""

Curtis also issued a prepared statement, saying it's ""essential"" that ""Utahns have equal access to justice.""

""This bill addresses the challenges that southeastern Utah residents face, harkening back to the values of our pioneer ancestors who laid the foundation of our great state,"" Curtis said. ""Just as they built communities, we must ensure that the justice system serves all Utahns, no matter where they live. With this bill's passage, we can ensure that rural Utahns have fair opportunities for a speedy trial and can fulfill their civic duties without undue burden.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"St. George, Utah, Fremont, Antelope Island, Curtis, Ogden, Salt Lake City, Colorado, the United States"
supply chain disruption,"'National security is the foundation for growth,' defence secretary launches new strategy to boost UK jobs and growth - Caribbean News Global",Caribbean News Global,https://caribbeannewsglobal.com/national-security-is-the-foundation-for-growth-defence-secretary-launches-new-strategy-to-boost-uk-jobs-and-growth/,"LONDON, England - UK based defence firms will be prioritised for government investment under a new defence industrial strategy that will drive economic growth, boost British jobs and strengthen national security.

Defence Secretary, John Healey on Monday 2 December launched the Government's Defence Industrial Strategy - by inviting investors, innovators, industry and trade unions to give their views on how to grow a better, more integrated, more innovative and more resilient defence sector.

Speaking at a London Defence Conference event with investors in London, Healey will set an ambition to increase defence sector jobs in ""every nation and region of the UK"". A strong defence sector can help provide ""the foundation for a decade of national renewal,"" Healey said. And will publish a new Statement of Intent for the Defence Industrial Strategy.

With global threats increasing, the Government's Defence Industrial Strategy will place deterrence at the heart of a new approach, to ensure adversaries know the UK has an industrial base that can innovate at a wartime pace.

In a sign of the government's commitment to develop a faster, more resilient supply chain, a first-of-its-kind wargame will begin today with the UK defence industry. The wargame will explore how industry and the MOD could sustain personnel on the frontline when faced with constant supply chain disruption and intense fighting.

The strategy will help make the defence sector an engine for UK growth and will strengthen domestic supply chains in critical areas, such as semi-conductors and steel. The new government has already invested in the acquisition of a defence semiconductor factory in County Durham. The new strategy will show how public investment and long-term certainty can help crowd-in billions in private investment into UK Defence and will ""mobilise the private sector to help face down global threats.""

In a show of support for this approach, Mondays announcement comes as defence companies announce major new investments and facilities, helping boost jobs and growth across Britain.

Minister for defence procurement and industry, Maria Eagle, will also visit Barrow-in-Furness on Monday where BAE Systems' skilled workers are building the UK's new nuclear submarines and will benefit from the further investment.

The new government is seeking to address some of the problems of the past which have held back growth in the defence sector, including inefficient spending, skills shortages, a lack of focus on exports and long-term partnerships. The government will deliver for British businesses and the public through this step-change in approach.

At the centre of the strategy is the government's growth mission - bringing benefits to every region and nation in the UK. The defence sector already supports 1 in 60 jobs in the UK - 434,000 good, well-paid jobs, with the majority (67%) outside London and the Southeast.

Defence secretary Healey, said:

""Our defence sector should be an engine for jobs and growth, strengthening our security and economy. That requires a defence industry that is better and more integrated - one that can keep our Armed Forces equipped, innovating at a wartime pace, and ahead of our adversaries.

""We will develop this new Defence Industrial Strategy with industry, with innovators and with workers. We will mobilise the private sector to help face down global threats, direct more public investment to British businesses and create jobs and growth in every nation and region of the UK.

""National security is the foundation for national stability and growth. We are sending a signal to the market and to our adversaries: with a strong UK defence sector we will make Britain secure at home and strong abroad.""

The new strategy will be shaped with the defence industry, identifying opportunities to innovate at speed, with the resilience to deter aggression by adversaries, able to seize the opportunity presented by the technologies of the future, while growing the UK's share of the exports market.

Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, said:

""The government underlining the importance of the defence sector to the UK economy is hugely welcomed, particularly the sector's inclusion as a high priority area for growth. ADS has consistently convened meaningful engagement between our members, MOD and wider stakeholders, and we look forward to continuing this in the latest phase. Industry greatly appreciates the opportunity for deep involvement with these processes. To deliver the right capability to support the UK's ability to deter, it is pivotal that we continue to contribute to military planning activities.""

The government is also appointing a fully-fledged National Armaments director. It aims to ensure the armed forces are properly equipped to defend Britain, to build up the British defence industry and to crack down on waste.

The government's primary mission is to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 - with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country - and with more than 200,000 UK jobs supported through spend with the defence industry, the new strategy will have a key role to play in this.

The strategy was a manifesto pledge and is expected to be published in the first half of 2025. The government has committed to spending 2.5 percent of GDP on defence and will set a clear path in the Spring.

Under this government, there has been renewed confidence in the UK defence industry, including Rheinmetall committing a new factory which will see the UK manufacture artillery gun barrels for the first time in ten years, using British steel produced by Sheffield Forgemasters.

The last Defence Industrial Strategy was published in 2021, before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The new Defence Industrial Strategy will align with the Strategic Defence Review.

The Defence Industrial Strategy is commissioned by the Defence Secretary and will be the sector plan for defence in government's wider industrial strategy. The ministry of defence and the department for business and trade will work to ensure the Defence Industrial Strategy and upcoming trade strategy is complimentary.",,,,N/A,N/A,"England, UK, London, County Durham, Britain, Russia, Ukraine, LONDON"
supply chain disruption,UK manufacturing PMI sinks to 9-month low as orders dry up,Cyprus Mail,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/12/07/uk-manufacturing-pmi-sinks-to-9-month-low-as-orders-dry-up/,"A gauge of British manufacturing activity pointed to the sharpest contraction in nine months, as orders from domestic and foreign customers fell and ongoing supply chain disruption pushed up costs.

The S&P Global manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index sank to 48.0 in November from 49.9 in October - below an earlier estimate of 48.6 and the 50 level that divides growth from contraction.

S&P cited headwinds from a 25 billion pound ($32 billion) rise in employment taxes in the new Labour government's Oct. 30 budget, a 7 per cent increase in Britain's minimum wage, disruption to shipping in the Red Sea and the threat of global goods tariffs.

""Manufacturers are left facing an environment of high costs, low demand and raised uncertainty for the foreseeable future,"" S&P director Rob Dobson said.

""While companies of all sizes are experiencing a downturn, small companies are the hardest hit, reporting especially marked drops in output, new orders and new export business,"" he added.

Last week US President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all goods the United States imports from Canada and Mexico and he has floated blanket tariffs of 10 per cent to 20 per cent on virtually all imports.

Some businesses said clients were delaying or cancelling investment projects due to increased costs following the budget and broader global uncertainty, S&P said.

Orders, output and employment all fell at the fastest pace in nine months.

supply chain disruption,Fields on Wheels casts eyes on food supply chain links,Winnipeg Free Press,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/2024/12/06/fields-on-wheels-casts-eyes-on-food-supply-chain-links,"I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.

Long before the words ""supply chain disruption"" became common parlance, Barry Prentice, a professor at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba, helped create its department of supply chain management.

Known for, among other things, his enthusiasm for the potential airships could have in opening up the movement of goods in the North, Prentice also organizes the annual Fields on Wheels conference that invites experts to focus on issue of agribusiness logistics.

This year's (virtual) 29th conference focuses on food prices -- an issue so important it may have decided the recent U.S. presidential election.

With experts like Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, who will provide an assessment of trends in food prices and some issues resulting from a second Trump administration that could affect Canada, the conference will bring together a wide range of interests connected by agricultural supply chains.

Canada enjoys a natural advantage in the production of agricultural goods to trade on world markets.

In an open trading economy, the impacts of global events find their way home to the grocery store as much as to the farmstead.

Closer to home, there are also issues surrounding food security and food costs in the North that will be discussed at the free conference Wednesday. (Registration is open to the public at eventbrite.ca.)

Volker Kromm, executive director of the Thunder Bay-based Regional Food Distribution Association, will speak on increasing demand for food assistance and efforts in northwest Ontario to build food distribution capacity.

Kromm has been working with many in the region to try to develop a network so remote communities can operate something similar to urban food banks.

A while ago, folks from Pikangikum (about 100 kilometres north of Red Lake, Ont.) reached out to Kromm, asking why can't they have access to food from the RFDA.

""I said, we just have to figure out how to get it to them,"" Kromm said in an interview. ""But the problem was, when we sent food to Pikangikum, there was no place to put it.""

Kromm is working in tandem with First Nations in the region that are putting together a bulk-buying group.

Adding to the high cost of transporting food to remote locations is the logistics of storage and distribution. Kromm said he's made the mistake of shipping food stuffs to communities that had no capacity to handle it, resulting in waste.

He is in the process of building a $60-million expansion to facilities in Thunder Bay and a satellite warehouse in Ignace, 250 kilometres northwest.

""It's my pilot project and about six more communities who say they want to get in on it,"" he said.

""The idea is to have a few storage sites so that we could distribute food, whether it be charitable food or purchased bulk food.""

While the cost of getting food to the North is not coming down, Kromm said there is more funding available for capacity-building.

Meantime, Prentice has often noted a huge chunk of food inflation is a function of the supply chain.

""Something like an average of about 90 per cent of all the cost of food occurs beyond the farm,"" the U of M researcher said.

""I like to tell my students the cap on a bottle of beer is worth more than the barley (inside).""

Prentice believes while the rise in the cost of food has been dramatic -- maybe more so recently than in the previous 29 years -- it's just another impact of increased interest rates, energy costs and rising wages.

""It all adds to the supply chain expenses that have helped create the rise in food prices,"" he said.",,,,N/A,N/A,"U.S., Canada, Ontario, Red Lake, Ignace"
supply chain disruption,"Containing US, EU, and UK sanctions risks in a time of global crisis",nortonrosefulbright.com,https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/knowledge/publications/0c7bd634/containing-us-eu-and-uk-sanctions-risks-in-a-time-of-global-crisis,"The main regulator of US sanctions programs is the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC""). The US Department of State collaborates with OFAC, is a key player in policy guidance, including licensing decisions, and has a primary role with respect to secondary sanctions. In addition, the US Department of Commerce administers often parallel export controls on US-origin goods, services, and technology. While OFAC issues civil penalties for sanctions violations, criminal penalties are handled by the US Department of Justice.

The pandemic has magnified the challenges of complying with sanctions laws, as companies are operating in a stressful and uncertain economic environment, and resources that otherwise would be directed to sanctions compliance may be strained. Meanwhile, the pace of regulatory and investigative activity shows no signs of slowdown.

A. New internal and external threats

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, companies with international business have had to confront significant business pressures due to supply chain disruption, quarantines and travel restrictions, and other barriers to cross-border trade and transactions. These constraints can make companies more vulnerable to sanctioned parties and other bad actors, or more likely to engage in higher risk transactions, such as transactions with customers or third parties that have close ties to sanctioned parties or corrupt government officials, or have questionable sources of wealth or payments. For example, a company whose supplier has had to shut down its factories and who urgently needs to source goods to fill an order might fast-track an alternative supplier through its vetting process and inadvertently miss that it is, say, owned or controlled by an EU asset freeze target. Even if that entity is not on the EU consolidated list, it would be considered to be sanctioned and the company's transactions with that entity would be prohibited (if it is an EU company or potentially if there another EU nexus to the business). As another example, a company that has lost significant business as a result of COVID-19 may not apply the same level of scrutiny to payments, customers, or third parties that it ordinarily would, and might miss that a customer is a shell company owned by a Russian oligarch who has been designated as an SDN (meaning if there is a US company or there is a US nexus to the transaction, the transaction is prohibited, or even where there is no US nexus, the transaction could result in SDN designation risk or secondary sanctions risk) or that payments are derived from illegitimate sources. Further, in these circumstances, companies may not have the resources or capability to properly consider the details and nuances of particular sanctions restrictions, or the wording of a particular license or guidance from a sanctions authority, resulting in a lack of understanding of their actual legal risk. Companies should, therefore, be mindful of potential vulnerabilities presented by the current crisis, and take appropriate steps to avoid compliance pitfalls.

The new remote working environment has created some benefits, but also can complicate compliance efforts. It can make it more difficult to monitor suspicious activity and ongoing risks, and therefore harder to detect and prevent potential violations. Internal controls, including approval processes and reporting mechanisms, designed to identify or thwart unlawful activity also may be disrupted because the responsible personnel or systems are unavailable or less accessible. With more employees working remotely, there are also a greater number of potential threats internally as organizations are navigating new barriers to connectivity and becoming more decentralized, which might make it more difficult for the tone from the top to get disseminated widely or to maintain a unified culture of compliance. Many companies also have had to contend with logistical difficulties conducting audits, internal investigations, trainings, and site visits for data collection. For example, the nuances of body language may get lost when conducting an interview via a virtual platform, it may be difficult to evaluate audience participation in a virtual training, or it may not be possible to travel abroad to collect documents for an investigation. While companies are increasingly reopening, if some measure of distancing and remote working continues for the near future, some of these staffing, resource, and logistical challenges to compliance may remain.

B. Potential for increased investigations and enforcement

Despite increased vulnerabilities during the pandemic, there are no signs that enforcement authorities are easing their sanctions compliance expectations. Given the potential for increased bad conduct during times of economic crisis, one can expect a corollary increase in government investigations and enforcement following an economic downturn. Furthermore, in more recent years, sanctions have been more aggressively enforced and are increasingly being wielded as a tool to advance national security and foreign policy interests. In addition, regulators within the US (both at the federal and state levels) and worldwide are coordinating more frequently, and, in the US, sanctions investigations are more often overlapping with investigations relating to anti-money laundering, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Export Administration Regulations, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. For example, the criminal charges that were announced on April 20, 2020 against Industrial Bank of Korea (""IBK"") following coordinated state and federal efforts involve alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and deficiencies in its anti-money laundering program at IBK's New York branch, which allegedly permitted the processing of more than $1 billion in transactions in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Companies should keep in mind, therefore, that their international trade and transactions could be subject to scrutiny from multiple regulators in addition to sanctions authorities, and misconduct involving one area of the law or one jurisdiction, can spiral into cross-border or interagency investigations.

C. Recent regulatory and legislative developments

Since March 13, 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, OFAC has had a steady stream of new designations and other actions, both related and unrelated to COVID-19. These actions are not all detailed here, but key developments related to COVID-19 include (1) OFAC's issuance on March 6, 2020 of a Frequently Asked Question (#828) related to humanitarian assistance with regard to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran; (2) the Treasury Department's issuance of a press release on April 9, 2020 underscoring its commitment to the global flow of humanitarian aid in the face of COVID-19; (3) OFAC's publication on April 16, 2020 of a fact-sheet on the provision of humanitarian assistance and trade to combat COVID-19; (4) OFAC's issuance of guidance on April 20, 2020 encouraging persons to communicate OFAC compliance concerns related to COVID-19; and (5) OFAC's issuance on June 5, 2020 of a Frequently Asked Question (#830) stating that OFAC is not targeting Iranian manufacturers of medicines, medical devices, or products used for sanitation or hygiene or as personal protective equipment for use in Iran pursuant to Executive Order 13902 for continuing to manufacture these items.

While OFAC has acknowledged that companies are shifting resources away from sanctions compliance programs and it would evaluate these issues on a case-by-case basis, companies should understand that this flexibility is not unconditional. In its guidance dated April 20, 2020, OFAC stated:

""If a business facing technical and resource challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic chooses, as part of its risk-based approach to sanctions compliance, to account for such challenges by temporarily reallocating sanctions compliance resources consistent with that approach, OFAC will evaluate this as a factor in determining the appropriate administrative response to an apparent violation that occurs during this period.""

Importantly, OFAC indicated that a company's decision to reallocate its resources to other areas needs to be consistent with its risk-based approach to sanctions compliance and this reallocation must be caused by the pandemic and temporary. In addition, OFAC's guidance encourages businesses affected by COVID-19 to contact OFAC as soon as practicable if they believe they may experience delays in their ability to meet OFAC's deadlines, including requirements related to filing blocking and reject reports within ten (10) business days, responses to administrative subpoenas, reports required by general or specific licenses, or any other required reports or submissions. Far from providing a carte blanche to companies, therefore, OFAC's announcement signals that its compliance expectations have not eased and if companies are facing pandemic-related challenges, OFAC is willing to consider those as a mitigating factor in its assessment of the appropriate administrative response. However, companies must be prepared to show that their reassignment of compliance resources was part of a risk-based approach to sanctions compliance. Companies should, therefore, carefully consider how they are allocating their compliance resources and ensure that any decisions to shift resources away from sanctions compliance are reasonably commensurate with their risk profile and carefully documented.

Those engaged in the international flow of humanitarian aid also should keep in mind that while OFAC has emphasized its commitment to such aid to areas affected by COVID-19, OFAC has not, to date, expanded upon its existing and longstanding humanitarian exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations. OFAC's fact sheet dated April 16, 2020 highlights the most relevant exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations for humanitarian assistance and trade under the Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Ukraine/Russia-related sanctions programs. The fact sheet also provides specific guidance for OFAC-administered sanctions programs related to personal protective equipment, such as face shields and masks, gloves, clothing, and certain respirators and ventilators, and other COVID-19-related humanitarian assistance and trade. For transactions not otherwise covered by the existing exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations, OFAC notes that license requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and it will prioritize applications, compliance questions, and other requests related to humanitarian support, in relation to the people of these countries.

Further, as the Treasury Department has cautioned, such humanitarian assistance has the potential to be misused and/or diverted by bad actors. In its April 9, 2020 press release, the Treasury Department stated that ""[w]hile the vast majority of US-based non-profit organizations are at low risk for terrorist financing, humanitarian organizations delivering assistance to conflict regions face a potentially higher risk of aid diversion in support of terrorist financing, corruption, or other illicit purposes."" OFAC also has advised organizations seeking to provide humanitarian assistance to sanctioned countries impacted by the virus to implement reasonable, risk-based compliance measures, including due diligence, governance, transparency, accountability, and other such measures. Therefore, although OFAC has articulated its support for humanitarian aid to virus-affected areas, including sanctioned countries, it has warned companies to be wary of bad actors seeking to exploit these authorizations.

On the legislative front, several bills have been introduced following the virus outbreak, authorizing the imposition of sanctions for certain pandemic-related misconduct. For example, certain bills would impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in deliberate acts to conceal or distort information COVID-19, and would specifically target certain Chinese officials and entities.

There also have been several EU sanctions-related developments relating to COVID-19, including the following:

These recent developments, along with others unrelated to COVID-19, such as OFAC's recent issuance of maritime advisory guidance (covered in our separate briefing here), indicate that the US and EU remain committed to actively administering and enforcing sanctions laws during the pandemic, and companies need to be vigilant about ongoing and emergent sanctions risks.",,billion,,N/A,N/A,"Cuba, US, Syria, Ukraine, North Korea, Russia, Iran, New York, Venezuela"
supply chain disruption,Schumer visits Little Falls to push for dairy farmer support,CNYhomepage,https://www.cnyhomepage.com/news/local-news/schumer-visits-little-falls-to-push-for-dairy-farmer-support/,"LITTLE FALLS, NY (WUTR/WFXV/WPNY) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was in Little Falls on Friday, December 3 to push for senators to avoid a ""dairy cliff.""

Standing at the Casler Family Farm in Little Falls, Schumer revealed that the Dairy Margin Coverage Program (DMC) is set to expire at the end of the month. Schumer said that if the country goes over the ""dairy cliff,"" Herkimer County's 85 dairy farms could lose out on much-needed support and cause massive disruptions in the supply chain.

The DMC is a risk-management tool that offers protection to dairy farmers. The tool is used when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed price -- also known as the ""margin"" -- falls below a certain amount selected by the producer. Schumer said that if the DMC is allowed to expire, dairy farmers would lose out on monthly payments provided by the program. That in turn could cause a massive supply chain disruption that could reduce access to -- and increase the price of -- dairy products.

""Dairy is the lifeblood of Herkimer County agriculture with over 10,000 dairy cows producing over 70% of the county's agricultural sales dollars. But by the end of this year many of our Mohawk Valley dairy farms could be looking over a 'dairy cliff' that threatens lifeline payments, puts the industry in limbo, and increases the price of milk,"" Senator Schumer said in a statement. ""The Dairy Margin Coverage Program is essential to support our farmers, like Casler Family Farm, and to keep the best quality milk made from New York farms flowing to families across America. I helped enact the Dairy Margin Coverage Program in the 2018 Farm Bill and it is imperative we extend it before it expires at the end of this year. I will not stop fighting to ensure this critical program and safety net for our Upstate dairy farmers is protected.""

Casler Family Farm alone produces approximately 120,000 gallons of milk from its approximately 110 cows annually. In the last three to four years, the farm has received approximately $20,000 from the DMC.

In all, Herkimer County produced almost $66 million in dairy sales among its 85 farms, making it the 22nd-biggest dairy-producing county in New York, according to the Department of Agriculture. That accounts for over 70 percent of the county's agricultural sales every year.

In comparison, Oneida County's 138 dairy farms make it the 14th-biggest county.

New York State is also one of the largest dairy states in the nation, producing over 16 billion pounds of milk annually among its approximately 3,000 farms. That makes New York the fifth-largest dairy state in the United States.

""The dairy industry is a vital part of the economy here in New York State. Dairy farms provide jobs and revenue within our rural communities which helps support our schools and other businesses throughout the state. DMC has been a critical program over the last decade to sustain dairy producers through times of low milk prices and high feed costs,"" USDA FSA New York State Executive Director Jim Barber said in a statement. ""I want to sincerely thank Senator Schumer for his long-standing support of the DMC program and his push to get it extended for 2024 and hopefully, again for 2025.""

However, if Congress doesn't reauthorize the Farm Bill -- which received a one-year extension last September -- farmers could see detrimental impacts begin almost immediately.

Should the Farm Bill be allowed to lapse, the country would be required to purchase milk at a price that would cost them billions of dollars in spending, which Schumer said could be passed on to the customer. Consumers may see fewer options for milk in stores, while products like baby formula, protein powder and other dairy products may see limited availability.

""Herkimer County is at the heart of Upstate New York's dairy industry, and the looming ""Dairy Cliff"" threatens an essential safety net for our dairy farmers. Going over the Dairy Cliff would add more risk and uncertainty into dairy markets, disrupt supply chains, increase milk prices at grocery stores, and more. With most of Herkimer County's agricultural sales driven by dairy farms, renewal of the Dairy Margin Coverage Program is absolutely critical to maintaining the stable dairy markets that the countless rural, farm-driven communities across our region depend on,"" Little Falls Town Supervisor and Casler Family Farm Owner Daniel Casler said in a statement. ""On behalf of dairy farmers in Herkimer County and across New York State, I would like to extend our collective appreciation to Senator Schumer for fighting to reauthorize the Dairy Margin Coverage program and protect our state's dairy farms. I've heard it said before that the greatest function of Government is to do for the tax-paying citizenry what they cannot ordinarily do for themselves.

Three issues ranking at top of mind for supply chain executives in 2025 will be supply chain restrictions, reputational risk, and quantifying risk exposure, according to Moody's, a global integrated risk assessment firm.

Each of those points could have a stark impact on business operations, the firm said. First, supply chain restrictions will continue to drive up costs, following examples like European tariffs on Chinese autos and the U.S. plan to prevent Chinese software and hardware from entering cars in America.

Second, reputational risk will peak due to increased corporate transparency and due diligence laws, such as Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act that addresses hotpoint issues like modern slavery, forced labor, human trafficking, and environmental damage. In an age when polarized public opinion is combined with ever-present social media, doing business with a supplier whom a lot of your customers view negatively will be hard to navigate.

And third, advances in data, technology, and supplier risk assessments will enable executives to measure the impact of disruptions more effectively. Those calculations can help organizations determine whether their risk mitigation strategies represent value for money when compared to the potential revenues losses in the event of a supply chain disruption.

""Looking past the holidays, retailers will need to prepare for the typical challenges posed by seasonal slowdown in consumer demand. This year, however, there will be much less of a lull, as U.S. companies are accelerating some purchases that could potentially be impacted by a new wave of tariffs on U.S. imports,"" Andrei Quinn-Barabanov, Senior Director - Supplier Risk Management Solutions at Moody's, said in a release. ""Tariffs, sanctions and other supply chain restrictions will likely be top of the 2025 agenda for procurement executives.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"America, U.S., Germany"

Data collection and reporting processes focusing on sustainability are often driven by voluntary reporting or regulatory requirements, but sustainability data can be deployed to enhance market value and benefit the entire enterprise.

Many companies are in the early stages of their sustainability data management journey. As organizations develop sustainability data management systems focused on what data they need for reporting and compliance purposes and where they can locate it, they can also integrate that data into strategic planning and innovation, says Mike Danitz, a principal in the Finance and Enterprise Performance practice with Deloitte Consulting LLP, during a recent webcast, Sustainability and Data Management: Unleashing the Value Beyond Reporting.

""Although there are challenges in collecting and processing data from disparate data sources, AI-enhanced sustainability software and platforms offer compelling potential for enhancing sustainability data management, particularly in improving data accuracy, predictive analytics, data collection, and real-time environmental monitoring,"" Danitz says. As reporting shifts from voluntary to mandatory under requirements such as the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD),1 many companies are faced with a challenge of applying rigor to their nonfinancial metrics as they have historically with financial data.

Danitz discussed the challenges and possibilities of developing sustainability data management capabilities with Emma Grande, director of ESG Strategy and Engagement at Salesforce; Brian Komar, vice president of Sustainability Customer Programs at Salesforce; Paul Ziemba, technology lead for Salesforce Sustainability solutions at Deloitte Consulting, LLP; and Luis Galito, a principal and Salesforce Sustainability Offerings lead with Deloitte Consulting LLP.

Danitz: How can companies recognize more value from their sustainability data beyond reporting compliance?

Ziemba: Sustainability data can help companies increase revenue, reduce costs, and mitigate risks. In terms of revenue growth, we see indicators in the market that consumers prefer ethically sourced products and services like fair-trade coffee, renewable energy, and electric vehicles, which can command price premiums and increase customer loyalty. As carbon pricing evolves globally, reductions in carbon emissions can also provide value through offsets and credits.

As for cost efficiency, sustainability data can help organizations improve operational practices, and transparency about sustainability efforts may result in lower capital costs. It can also help organizations retain talent as many workers are increasingly focused on corporate sustainability performance. To help mitigate risks, sustainability data can be used to reduce supply chain disruption, maintain supply availability, and protect the organization from penalties and taxes associated with noncompliance as well as protecting brand reputation by helping prevent the appearance of greenwashing.

Komar: Focusing on the value that comes from sustainability data is critical. We have seen many examples of multinational and Fortune 500 companies that are increasing their asset efficiency, reducing emissions intensity, and reducing costs in ways that are improving the bottom line. We see organizations identifying opportunities for new products and services driving growth that are particularly compelling. The main challenge is enabling C-suite leaders across enterprises to leverage the data for innovation to unlock opportunity.

What are some of the challenges in enabling more effective sustainability data management, and how can they be mitigated?

Ziemba: The main challenge companies face is accessing reliable, detailed data. They often struggle with either no access or data that's hard to interpret because it comes from spreadsheets, manual processes, or inconsistent views. Many companies are focusing on assessing their current data and finding ways to make it more detailed, repeatable, or harmonized on a platform or through a process.

Komar: Companies can start by considering the various standards and frameworks they aim to meet. For example, CSRD requires more than 1,100 data points covering not only environmental issues but also social and governance issues. A platform approach can help companies report to several difficult requirements, enabling companies to input the data once and then report to multiple destinations.

How can AI help organizations meet the data management challenges?

Grande: It's common for organizations to begin with predictive analytics for setting long-term objectives. For example, if a company aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, part of that strategy might include looking at business travel and setting goals to reduce the total number of flights. Using predictive analytics helps project future travel trends, enabling a decrease in travel emissions under Scope 3. In other use cases, depending on the industry, AI can also help with real-time environmental data. For instance, it can enhance monitoring of weather, water usage, or energy consumption.

By combining predictive analytics and real-time data capabilities, businesses can not only set ambitious sustainability goals but also take informed actions to achieve them. At Salesforce, for example, we've created an AI agent to support our sustainability team, which surfaces key insights from our sustainability data, helping to optimize the collection, analysis, and sharing of information with stakeholders.

What are some possible use cases for generative AI in this respect?

Galito: AI has demonstrated its ability to automate routine tasks, provide personalized insights and recommendations, and enhance decision-making through rapid data aggregation and advanced predictive analytics. AI can also improve the streamlining of risk management and compliance by detecting fraud and data anomalies, aiding in regulatory compliance and report preparation.

For sustainability specifically, generative AI can drive improvements in sustainability data performance management by automating data validation, report configuration, and cross-functional outreach activities. It can help reduce noncompliance penalties by identifying emerging regulatory requirements and configuring report templates accordingly, and it supports data fidelity in sustainability data management platforms.

For Scope 3 emissions, generative AI can be used to improve inventory accuracy by automating engagement and follow-up with the supply chain to ensure complete and accurate data submission. Additionally, it can forecast KPI progression and risks, proactively influencing sustainability trajectories through advanced predictive insights.

Grande: Generative AI can bring efficiencies to sustainability reporting. Where organizations are still dependent on manual, labor-intensive processes for voluntary reporting, these processes are likely not scalable given the increasing statutory requirements from multiple countries. Generative AI can help streamline and automate these processes, making them faster, smarter, and more consistent.

What are your suggestions for senior leaders who want to improve their sustainability data management practices?

Ziemba: A platform approach that can be scaled and adapted as an organization's needs change and regulations evolve is an important starting point. Adopting practices to promote data accuracy and quality is paramount as expectations grow for data to be auditable and traceable. The use of analytics and visualizations is also important for deriving value, enabling people to forecast emissions, explore scenarios, and track progress efficiently. Change management is also important for enabling adoption of data management approaches to identify, understand, and meet the needs of stakeholders.

Komar: Leaders should focus on the culture or the conditions that are in place to enable transformation leveraging good practices. For example, a cross-functional leadership group that includes finance, sustainability, and technology teams can work together collaboratively to enable transformation. Leaders can focus on establishing a data tooling effort to manage the vast and diverse types of immature and unstructured data that needs to be managed.

This process often takes longer than anticipated and is crucial for meeting regulatory and compliance timelines. Investment in talent is also critical for enabling transformation. Upskilling and training the workforce to enable new capabilities in data management is essential.

Galito: Set the tone from the top. Leaders can highlight the importance of sustainability and promote understanding of its significance. This involves integrating sustainable practices into the entire enterprise and educating people on how these efforts affect business units. By doing this, organizations can align on common sustainability goals and make investments in technology and data that are future-proof and scalable.

Grande: Build internal alignments. Leaders may not be accustomed to discussing topics like human capital externally, but they can break through silos and share sustainability data insights with both executives and frontline employees to help shape the narrative and prepare for external communication.

supply chain disruption,Increase in Aniline prices in the USA during November 2024,chemanalyst.com,https://www.chemanalyst.com/NewsAndDeals/NewsDetails/increase-in-aniline-prices-in-the-usa-during-november-2024-31980,"In November 2024, the North American Aniline market experienced a bullish trend, driven by steady consumption and constrained supply availability. The market faced supply constraints, which were exacerbated by disruptions in production and logistics, leading to a tightening of inventory levels.

In the first half of the month, the Aniline production rates were intermediate in the producing country, supported by moderate feedstock availability. At the same time, supply levels from China, a key Aniline exporting market, were slightly reduced due to ongoing disruptions in container shipping services in the East China Sea. Port congestion and vessel delays caused by Typhoon Kong-Rey, which struck Taiwan and moved northward, affected eastern China and Japan, further complicating supply chains.

The Aniline offtakes stayed consistent in the pharmaceutical industry. The Pharmaceutical sector showed signs of recovery, driven by multiple FDA approvals that helped companies like Gilead Sciences and Bristol Myers Squibb rebound from previous market capitalization declines. US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts enabled industry leaders to advance R&D pipelines and form billion-dollar strategic alliances, buffering the impact of upcoming patent cliffs. Meanwhile, the generics business grew across all regions, with a 30% increase in the U.S. Meanwhile, the order for Aniline remained moderate from Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate manufacturers, influenced by varied consumption of isocyanates in the Polyurethane sector. The demand for polyurethane materials remained strong in the automotive industry. In October, an increment of 12.8% from a month ago and a 9.6% increase from a year ago, as given by the preliminary figures, including the estimates for the GM/Stellantis/Tesla and other sales figures. However, the consumption of polyurethane materials was slow in the construction industry. In October 2024, the U.S. construction sector faced ongoing labor and material shortages, delaying projects and straining cash flows. Despite a 4.6% year-on-year increase in construction spending for September, growth was hindered by delays. Private and public construction saw modest month-on-month gains, with notable investments in highways and education.

Meanwhile, in the second half of November, Aniline prices were briefly impacted by rising inventory levels in China, a key producer and exporter. This decline was driven by ongoing weak demand in the country and increased production following the restart of the Tianji Aniline plant, which negatively influenced the prices, and exporters reduced their quotations. However, supply chain disruption and steady demand from domestic buyers positively influenced the Aniline prices towards the end of the month. Conclusively, at the end of November 2024, Aniline CFR Texas prices hovered at USD 1380/MT after witnessing a 3.7% increase in last month's prices.",,,,N/A,N/A,"U.S., Typhoon Kong-Rey, Taiwan, Japan, China, Texas"
supply chain disruption,3 Reasons Why I Bought Celsius Stock | The Motley Fool,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/06/3-reasons-why-i-bought-celsius-stock/,"After weeks of pondering the decision, I finally made a move into Celsius Holdings (CELH -3.73%). Shares of the energy drink maker made massive gains under the leadership of CEO John Fieldly, highlighting his abilities to develop a following in the fitness community and score a lucrative distribution agreement with multinational behemoth PepsiCo.

Nonetheless, the beverage stock has pulled back significantly this year. It is in this environment that I bought Celsius shares, and three reasons explain why.

As mentioned, part of Celsius's competitive advantage came from its rising popularity among fitness enthusiasts. Unlike competitors, such as Red Bull and Monster, Celsius emphasizes natural ingredients such as green tea extract and ginger root. It also derives its caffeine source from guarana seeds, which have more than twice the caffeine of coffee beans. This approach has made it the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S.

Despite improving sales prospects for nature-based products, Celsius stock has fallen more than 70% from its high amid an inventory glut. A major Celsius distributor, likely PepsiCo, lowered its purchases to reduce inventory.

Consequently, in the third quarter of 2024, revenue dropped 31% from year-ago levels. So important was this drop that its revenue for the first nine months of 2024 totaled $1 billion. That's an increase of just 5% compared to the same period in 2023, and far below the 104% yearly growth rate in the first three quarters of 2023.

Moreover, net income for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to $131 million, 7% less than 12 months ago. That occurred amid a 31% increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The effect was particularly severe in the third quarter, as the most recent quarter earned Celsius only $1.5 million in net income.

However, Fieldly also stated in the Q3 earnings report that the supply chain optimization challenges with its largest distributor have ""largely stabilized."" While shareholders should still pay attention to that issue, signs of growth returning should help the stock.

An increase in international sales could boost revenue even more. Non-North America sales were only 5% of revenue in the first three quarters of 2024. That was up from 4% during the same timeframe in 2023, as its non-North American revenue rose 37% during the same period. This means the international market is largely untapped, pointing to the potential for more revenue growth longer-term.

The current challenges mean that investors can buy Celsius stock at a significant discount. Due to the stock's sharp pullback of over 70%, investors can buy shares at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that may sound high, this is far below the average 69 earnings multiple over the last year and represents an attractive level if the stabilized supply chain helps lead to a return of sales growth.

The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio appears to confirm this thesis. The current sales multiple of 4.9 is far below the 9.6 average over the last year and the 14 average in the last five years. This implies a massive discount for a stock that is more than likely experiencing a temporary growth setback.

Considering the current state of Celsius stock, I believe I bought it on a likely overreaction to the supply chain disruption. Indeed, less purchasing from its largest distributor is concerning. Nonetheless, that is likely a temporary setback, and its small but fast-growing international segment bodes well for its future in the long term.

Moreover, growing emphasis on natural products should help highlight its competitive advantage. When also considering the heavily discounted stock price and valuation metrics, buying Celsius stock was an easy decision.",,"billion, million, million",,N/A,N/A,U.S.

""I bring over 15 years of experience in product management, consultancy, and operations. I ensure that customer and market demands are thoughtfully integrated and applied innovatively within the Mitratech solution portfolio. My background is in governance, risk, and compliance, where I've developed and implemented solutions to address the increasingly complex challenges in risk management.""

What are the company's core products and features? Parr explained:

""Mitratech's Governance, Risk and Compliance suite offers end-to-end, top-to-bottom risk and compliance management capabilities, spanning:

Whether organizations are just starting to implement GRC processes or looking to deploy next-generation programs across their full enterprise, Mitratech simplifies the process with cross-industry applications, convenient out-of-the-box templates, and relevant analytics to empower data-driven business outcomes. Mitratech also offers a full suite of Corporate Legal and HR Compliance offerings.""

ESG Monitoring Feature

With ESG compliance becoming a growing priority for regulators and investors, how does Mitratech's new ESG monitoring feature help companies uphold sustainability standards throughout their supply chains? Parr emphasized:

""Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, such as measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have surely emerged as a key priority among companies, investors, and government regulators. Measuring GHG emissions involves focusing on direct emissions and extending attention to indirect emissions throughout the supply chain, where scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions come into play. As more governments legislate ESG and sustainability regulations, companies must sift through mountains of ESG reporting data to meet supply chain compliance requirements.

The Mitratech solution includes new capabilities that enhance ESG and sustainability monitoring and correlate with the results of questionnaire-based ESG risk assessments to standardize and simplify global ESG compliance reporting across your supply chain.

The latest release includes:

-- Globally sourced, standards-based data from a recognized leader in ESG and sustainability reporting.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news, and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

-- A comprehensive library of global sustainability questionnaires with built-in remediation guidance to benchmark reporting.

-- A centralized risk register of assessment results and sustainability data for investigation, triage, and task and event management.

By comprehensively understanding and managing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, companies can mitigate supply chain and reputational risks, meet stakeholder expectations, improve operational efficiency, and gain a competitive edge.""

Designing New Risk Management Tools

In light of this year's high-profile supply chain incidents, what insights did Mitratech apply in designing these new risk management tools? Parr replied:

""Our annual TPRM study showed that 61% of companies reported a third-party breach in 2023 - up nearly 50% in the last year and 3x since 2021. Due to growing supplier populations (often global), organizations are often unable to consistently visualize where their data goes and where proprietary or sensitive data can easily be shared with suppliers and subcontractors. What's more, third-party breaches are among the most expensive for organizations to recover from. Data from the 2024 IBM/Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach Report shows that third-party breaches are the third highest predictor of increased breach costs, increasing costs by 5% above the average.

The latest enhancements are meant to address growing supplier complexity by:

-- Quickly identifying vendors potentially at risk of a software supply chain disruption, reducing risk and speeding up the resolution process.

-- Reducing the time required to analyze the impact of supply chain events.

-- Improving supply chain risk visibility and saving time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence and controversies fully aligned with other enterprise risks.

-- Reducing the time required to populate new assessments, speeding risk analysis and remediation.""

Insights About ESG Scores For Suppliers

Sustainability and ESG have emerged as essential metrics for evaluating vendor relationships. Could you provide insights into the specific ESG criteria Mitratech's platform leverages to assess and score suppliers? Parr noted:

""The Mitratech solution provides insights into several ESG metrics.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

Data is presented over time, and with it users can compare suppliers against:

With the solution, procurement and supply chain teams can improve supply chain visibility and consistency and save time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence, and controversies, fully aligned with other enterprise risks.""

Evolution Of Mitratech's Technology

How has the company's technology evolved since launching? Parr replied:

""We first introduced our ESG capabilities in 2020 and have since added deeper Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions tracking, overall ESG score enrichment, and ESG controversy tracking to our library of ESG questionnaires, enabling organizations to keep pace with the ever-changing ESG regulatory landscape. As supply chains grow and become more complex, it's essential that organizations centrally track all of their supply chain risks - from cyber disruptions to operational, ESG, and reputational challenges. Our view is that our solution should become the single source of truth for all third-party vendor and supplier risks, which feeds into the overall GRC solution to manage enterprise risks.""

Significant Milestones

What have been some of the company's most significant milestones? Parr cited:

supply chain disruption,2025 - A look ahead to the year in retail tech,Chain Store Age,https://chainstoreage.com/2025-look-ahead-year-retail-tech,"The Target Store Companion AI-based mobile associate tool (Image: Target).

A new year brings new developments in retail technology.

As 2025 approaches, it's time to dust off the crystal ball and gaze into the trends that will drive the retail technology industry over the next 12 months. Here is a look at how supply chain disruption, AI ""co-piloting,"" and automated delivery will impact the industry:

Supply chain disruption

The global supply chain has recovered from the peak disruption levels of 2020 and 2021 and continues on an uneven course of improvement, but it still does not function as smoothly as it did pre-2020.

The supply chain also remains prone to shocks from ongoing global instability and climate events, as well as strikes affecting both ports and rail service. The possibility of new tariffs being imposed on imported goods in 2025 also raises uncertainty about how the supply chain will function.

All this will lead retailers to implement solutions that can help them better predict potential disruptions, react when they happen, and generally run their supply chains more smoothly to make the inevitable impact of disruptive events less dramatic.

On the predictive side, expect more retailers to follow in the footsteps of Dick's Sporting Goods, which utilizes Inspectorio sourcing and production technology to obtain seamless connection of traceability data with the rest of its sourcing operations, as well as automate manual processes with AI-equipped features.

[READ MORE: Dick's Sporting Goods centralizes sourcing and production with AI]

The retailer also intends to obtain enhanced visibility into performance and production changes and more easily identify which raw materials are being used across multiple purchase orders.

In terms of smoother supply chain operations, retailers should consider the example of Walmart, which runs high-tech fulfillment centers featuring an automated, high-density storage and retrieval system that streamlines a manual, 12-step process down to five steps. It also offers double the storage capacity and twice the number of customer orders the discounter can fulfill in a day, expanding next- or two-day shipping.

AI as co-pilot

Another trend that will help steer the direction of retail technology in 2025 is the growing realization that AI is not a cure-all and does not make things better on its own. Retailers are increasingly finding that the maximum value of AI is obtained when it serves as a ""co-pilot"" that enhances and expands the capabilities of a human user.

For example, Target Corp. is rolling out a new proprietary generative AI chatbot called Store Companion that will help store associates answer customer inquiries and on-the-job process questions, coach new team members and support store operations management.

The new chatbot will be available as an app on specially equipped handheld employee devices, providing immediate answers to their questions about processes and procedures.

On the customer-facing side, e-commerce marketplace Curated uses an AI consumer co-pilot to connect with customers who are a little bit earlier in their buying journey. This allows them to ask questions, start their educational process, and begin to understand the terminology about products.

""Our AI is trained on over two million conversations that our consumers have had with our experts,"" Peter Ombres, CEO and co-founder of Curated, said in an exclusive interview with Chain Store Age. ""This database of interactions helps make our AI extremely useful in the context of shopping.""

However, Curated has found that most customers reach a point in their buying journey where they have questions that only a human can answer, and they are then transitioned to one of the e-tailer's human experts.

Automated delivery

The volume of deliveries keeps expanding and with it, consumer expectations for packages to arrive potentially within hours or even minutes of placing an order. It's no wonder that retailers continue to look to automated delivery technologies, a trend set to grow in 2025.

Drone technology is one of the most talked-about automated delivery solutions, and now that Amazon has received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permission to fly its Prime Air delivery drones beyond the visual line of sight of the pilot and Walmart is enabling select drone delivery orders directly in its app, other retailers will surely follow.

Some smaller retailers already have, such as quick service restaurant chains Panera Bread and Jet's Pizza recently launching delivery via Zipline drones in select markets.

Sidewalk robots are also a burgeoning automated delivery platform, as evidenced by recent rollouts from entities including Shake Shack, Uber Eats and Grubhub. And as driverless vehicles continue evolving, expect more pilots like Uber Eats' ongoing testing of Waymo robotaxis.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown
supply chain disruption,"IMF roots for South Sudan political stability, transparency to counter economic woes - Eye Radio",Eye Radio,https://www.eyeradio.org/imf-roots-for-south-sudan-political-stability-transparency-to-counter-economic-woes/,"The International Monetary Fund said it has noted with concern South Sudan's severe economic and humanitarian challenges, and recommends political stability and policy adjustment on governance and transparency as key to boosting donor confidence.

On November 15, 2024, IMF's Executive Board discussed the Third and Final Review of South Sudan's Staff-Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB), where it underscored that spillovers from the Sudan war have worsened South Sudan's macroeconomic situation and exacerbated an already difficult humanitarian situation.

In a press statement, IMF said it observed the country's severe economic and humanitarian situation, caused by the war in Sudan, flooding, and combined with domestic policy slippages.

It urges the South Sudan government to continue building on the progress made under the Management-endorsed Staff Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB) to restore economic stability and maintain debt sustainability.

""Concrete steps to strengthen political stability and address policy missteps and structural challenges, particularly on governance and transparency, would be essential to boost donor confidence,"" it said.

""Noting that program performance has significantly weakened, Directors welcomed the corrective measures taken by the authorities and their commitment to further remedial measures in support of the program's objectives, including efforts to clear salary arrears and prioritize critical social spending.""

The financial agency pointed out that ruptures on a pipeline carrying 70 percent of South Sudan's crude oil through Sudan has led to a sharp decline oil exports, resulting in lower foreign exchange inflows, currency depreciation and sharp fiscal revenue drop leading to the accumulation of salary arrears, and high inflation.

The war in Sudan has also led to a massive influx of over 800,000 people to South Sudan and supply chain disruption as more 7.1 million South Sudanese are estimated to be experiencing acute food insecurity.

IMF said the South Sudanese authorities face the challenging task of meeting higher spending needs, including on humanitarian relief, against the backdrop of limited financing options.

IMF's Board of Directors welcomed gradual depreciation of the official exchange rate to narrow the gap

with the parallel market and underscored the need for further adjustment to unify the Foreign Exchange markets and eliminate distortions.

The agency encouraged efforts to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and preserve financial stability, including by enacting remaining recommendations from the Safeguards Assessment.

It further said it positively noted the improvements in transparency and governance of fiscal and monetary operations and the oil sector and called for sustained efforts in these areas.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Sudan, South Sudan's, South Sudan"

This article describes how global electronic components distributors are bolstering rise in innovation, improving the efficiency of supply chains, and fostering technological development.

How Global Electronic Components Distributors Changing Strategies Towards the Delivery of Components

The demand for electronic components varies, but an electronic component distributors distribution model enables a consistent demand-supply symbiosis. Today's electronic components distributor help fill the relatively low supply of technology and complex devices required by various industries from sourcing, waiting in the long supply chains, caring about the quality and especially the technical support of devices to the integration into the systems.

Electronic component distributors cover distances and continents to procure parts and deliver them to their customers in other sectors. These businesses engage in more than simply delivering goods; they also manage stock, ensure quality control, and provide technical assistance so that their clientele can innovate without being concerned about supply chain disruption.

Promoting Creativity and New Ideas

Technological advancement in automotive, healthcare, telecommunications, and consumer electronics industries is the main driving force behind the growing demand for electronic components around the globe. Distribution partners fulfill such demands by ensuring prompt availability of the necessary components for new inventions.

Such reconfiguration in the automobile segment toward electric and autonomous vehicles has created a surge in demand for advanced sensors, processors, and connectivity modules. To meet these requirements, global electronic components distributors have developed strong supply chains in order to provide a specialized variety of components to automotive manufacturers.

Healthcare domain equally tends to experience an increasing demand for medical devices and wearables too. These equipment are dependent on minuscule electronic components which are being distributed for purchasing thanks to the deftness of distributors. As a result of the ability to produce such life-saving devices, distributors of electronic components play a positive role in global health and wellness.

Addressing Supply Chain Issues

The COVID-19 pandemic and the latest geopolitical issues have shown the weak points of global supply chains. Supply chain disruptions like parts supplies, which are scarce, and transport delays have hitherto demonstrated how valued reliable and agile distributors would be. Relying on global electronic components distributors has proved to be sustainable on solutions such as supplier bases diversifications, information technologies in inventory management, and construction of regional distribution centers.

Moreover, several distributors have taken up digitalisation as a solution to the challenges posed by supply chains. Virtual platforms and e-commerce solutions now enable customers to check stock, place orders, and even trace shipments and delivery timelines. Such visibility and ease improves the relationship built between distributors and customers while providing long-term attachment.

The Advancement of Technology in Distribution

How various electronic components are distributed around the globe Is now becoming controlled by technology. Advanced software solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) Have now become part and parcel of the operations of electronic components distributors. Predictive systems assist in demand forecasting, planning inventory to optimal levels, and supply chain risk and disruption.

Similarly, AI-enabled analytics enhance the ability of the components distributors to see which items will be in great demand in the future. So they can purchase them ahead of time to avoid running out In this way, businesses relying on the components can conduct business uninterrupted.

In addition, the use of automation in warehouses operates to improve the speed and efficiency of order processing, reception, and dispatch. Automated mechanisms can help to sort, pack, and ship orders which minimizes chances of error and maximizes customer satisfaction.

Sustainability in Distribution

The need and focus for sustainability have in the modern day prevailed in the core industrial sectors across the world such as the electronics sector. distributors on the other hand are practicing the use of biodegradable packaging for distribution to reduce degradation to the environment. By utilizing recyclable packaging materials and minimizing transportation distances' carbon emissions, distributors are contributing towards making the world greener.

Some distributors are also focusing on manufacturers that use sustainable practices. They are from the perspective of the manufacturers' ecologic footprint, promoting energy-efficient components usage and obsolete electronic parts recycling, thus advancing circular economy within the industry.

The Future of Electronic Components Distribution

Diversification of industries is characteristic for the development and the same applies to that of electronic components distributors. With the increasing use of emerging technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, new demands for specific components will arise. In this regard, it will be necessary to adapt to the trends by broadening the range of items in the product portfolio and improving the level of technical knowledge.

Moreover, the emergences of regional hubs will force the distributors to change their logistics strategy. The construction of local warehouses and distribution centres allows the businesses to meet the demands of local customers at lower transport expenses and shorter delivery time.

The shift towards customer experience is, however, expected to continue. The distributors that deploy modern systems and treat consumers personally are in the competitive edge. This encompasses providing kitted items and other components for complex projects supplemented with undertaking technical assistance.

Conclusion

The electronic components distributor in the global scope are in the epicenter of the ongoing industrial revolution and changing the systems for industries and manufacturers. Their function is quite beyond just providing components; they are enablers of progressive actions so that opportunities are explored and innovation is performed.

These distributors continue to be a profound player in the distribution of electronics by adopting technology, embedding ecological considerations and adjusting to emerging conditions. From facilitating the development and manufacture of self- vehicle systems to the latest gadgets the contributions of electronic components distributors cannot be exaggerated.

supply chain disruption,"IMF urges political stability, transparency to counter South Sudan's economic woes - Eye Radio",Eye Radio,https://www.eyeradio.org/imf-urges-political-stability-transparency-to-counter-south-sudans-economic-woes/,"The International Monetary Fund said it has noted with concern South Sudan's severe economic and humanitarian challenges, and recommends political stability and policy adjustment on governance and transparency as key to boosting donor confidence.

On November 15, 2024, IMF's Executive Board discussed the Third and Final Review of South Sudan's Staff-Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB), where it underscored that spillovers from the Sudan war have worsened South Sudan's macroeconomic situation and exacerbated an already difficult humanitarian situation.

In a press statement, IMF said it noted with concern the country's severe economic and humanitarian situation, caused by the war in Sudan and its spillovers, flooding, and combined with domestic policy slippages.

It urges the South Sudan government to continue building on the progress made under the Management-endorsed Staff Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB) to restore economic stability and maintain debt sustainability.

""Concrete steps to strengthen political stability and address policy missteps and structural challenges, particularly on governance and transparency, would be essential to boost donor confidence,"" it said.

""Noting that program performance has significantly weakened, Directors welcomed the corrective measures taken by the authorities and their commitment to further remedial measures in support of the program's objectives, including efforts to clear salary arrears and prioritize critical social spending.""

The financial agency pointed out that ruptures on a pipeline carrying 70 percent of South Sudan's crude oil through Sudan has led to a sharp decline oil exports, resulting in lower foreign exchange inflows, currency depreciation and sharp fiscal revenue drop leading to the accumulation of salary arrears, and high inflation.

The war in Sudan has also led to a massive influx of over 800,000 people to South Sudan and supply chain disruption as more 7.1 million South Sudanese are estimated to be experiencing acute food insecurity.

IMF said the South Sudanese authorities face the challenging task of meeting higher spending needs, including on humanitarian relief, against the backdrop of limited financing options.

IMF's Board of Directors welcomed gradual depreciation of the official exchange rate to narrow the gap

with the parallel market and underscored the need for further adjustment to unify the Foreign Exchange markets and eliminate distortions.

The agency encouraged efforts to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and preserve financial stability, including by enacting remaining recommendations from the Safeguards Assessment.

It further said it positively noted the improvements in transparency and governance of fiscal and monetary operations and the oil sector and called for sustained efforts in these areas.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Sudan, South Sudan's, South Sudan"
supply chain disruption,Proven ways to boost hotel food and drink profits,Yahoo! Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proven-ways-boost-hotel-food-071458660.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWxpZ29vLmRl&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFFYNooOwugx0Berj_FtJ8KOs_9g240stF9VKDu6IK8BKEYhqAJrwBBl9koyTq2x2-1YsUUnIq57pK3Tng3rRkVQftk_5H06aUU5MRYxnn9lpdHWFdOOgEtEa61yjwZFwjYu-fEBn5gGPM0r6h2wyoM9fz_575BOUW_ItQ0wPTqg,"The hospitality industry is facing unprecedented challenges, from rising operational costs to disrupted supply chains and evolving customer expectations.

Among the areas most impacted by these pressures is food and beverage (F&B) operations, where managing costs while maintaining high-quality service has become a critical concern for hotels.

For many hotel owners and operators, F&B is not only an essential part of the guest experience but also a key profit centre -- yet, it's an area where many are seeing margins erode.

Identifying the food cost margin gap

The difference between your actual profit margin and the potential profit margin in hotel F&B operations is known as the 'margin gap'.

The 'theoretical margin' is what your business could achieve if all operational processes were running perfectly, while the 'current margin' reflects the reality, often diminished by inefficiencies and waste.

The Entegra guide explains, ""Many hotels are losing revenue due to inefficiencies, waste, or missed opportunities that should be enhancing their bottom line.""

With the right strategies in place, it's possible to bridge this gap and optimise F&B operations to boost profitability. However, this process is more complex than it may first appear, and many hotels are finding it difficult to tackle on their own.

Optimising hotel F&B operations

In a time of persistent supply chain disruption, the ability to maintain cost-effective sourcing and ensure ingredient availability is vital. Effective supply chain management is key to optimising F&B operations in hotels.

""By streamlining supply chains, hotels can reduce costs, improve consistency, and maintain quality -- three factors that impact both guest satisfaction and profitability,"" notes the report.

Building strong relationships with suppliers and using technology to predict trends and forecast demand can significantly reduce wastage and prevent overordering.

2. Minimising waste with smart solutions

Food waste is a significant issue for hotels, directly impacting the bottom line.

In hotel F&B operations, every uneaten meal or discarded ingredient is lost revenue. Implementing practices such as portion control, menu design, and repurposing leftovers can have a marked effect on reducing waste.

""By tracking waste against sales data, hotels can gain insights into where the greatest inefficiencies lie,"" the guide suggests.

Hotels can also use technology to monitor waste more accurately, providing staff with the tools they need to adjust practices and reduce unnecessary losses.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

supply chain disruption,Panic hits used car importers as time ticks on 8-year rule,The Star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/business/2024-12-06-panic-hits-used-car-importers-as-time-ticks-on-8-year-rule,"The last time importers were hit by losses on late imports was in 2014, when more than 2,000 used motor vehicles registered in 2006 were locked out of the country.

Importers and dealers of second-hand cars in Kenya are staring at losses that could run into millions of shillings, on the back of delays in deliveries at the Port of Mombasa.

This is as a result of longer shipping time occasioned by disruption in the Red Sea as a result of the Houthi Rebels attacks which have now lasted a year, forcing shipping lines to continue re-routing to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa), before coming up to the East.

For instance, there has been an increased transit time between Mombasa and key global ports from an average 24 days to 40 days, with some ships taking even longer as they call at different ports before the final destination.

According to the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs), vehicles exported to Kenya shall be expected to comply with the eighty-year rule, which includes having a Certificate of Roadworthiness issued by Quality Inspection Services Inc. Japan (QSJ,) which is an inspection company contracted by Kebs.

""Any vehicle registered in 2017 or earlier, arriving after December 31, 2024 will be deemed not compliant and shall be rejected at the importer's expense,"" Kebs managing director Esther Ngari said in a notice issued on November 28.

With only 26 days to go before the December deadline for 2017 units, which locks out vehicles older than eight years under Kenya's second-hand rule, dealers are now worried the country could experience one of the worst incidences on failure to have units cleared on time.

""It could be worst than what we have seen before because unlike previous years where we would make early orders and have then arrive on time, voyages nowadays are unpredictable following the global supply chain disruption. We are seeking engagements with government to see how to avert losses,"" Car Importers Association of Kenya national chairman, Peter Otieno, told the Star yesterday.

The last time importers were hit by losses on late imports was in 2014, when more than 2,000 used motor vehicles registered in 2006 were locked out of the country.

Since then, importers have been beating the deadline with no major lockout reported, save for 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

During the year, more than 18,000 units manufactured in 2013 arrived late as a result of the pandemic's disruption in the shipping industry.

The government allowed clearance of units whose delays were solely as a result of shipping delays.","24 days, 40 days, 26 days",,"2017 units, 000 units",N/A,N/A,"Mombasa, Kenya, Japan, South Africa"

Subsequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25% and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75%. The rate decision is in line with market and economists expectations.

MPC also kept its monetary policy stance to 'neutral' and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth.

In his speech, RBI's governor Shaktikanta Das said, monetary policy is important because it effects the life of people. He added, ""Our effort is to follow the flexible inflation."" He said, price stability is important, but at the same time growth is also important.

RBI's policy decisions revolve around the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent while supporting growth.

RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged since February 2023, after hiking the key rate aggressively by 250 bps from May 2022-February 2023, due to the intense inflation pressure globally after supply-chain disruption escalated as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Currently, geopolitical tensions have continued at a boiling point in Russia and the Middle East.

Also, this is the last policy of RBI governor Shaktikanta Das' first tenure at the central bank. Das' six-year tenure will end on December 10, 2024. He joined RBI as governor on December 11, 2018. Whether the government extends his tenure or not ahead, will be keenly watched. If his tenure is extended, Das will become the longest governor of RBI in India.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Russia, Ukraine"

In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Corporate Consolidated Strategy and Outlook

Value Creation Strategy. Athabasca provides a differentiated liquids-weighted growth platform through its low-decline, long-life Thermal Oil assets. Athabasca's subsidiary company, Duvernay Energy Corporation (""DEC""), is designed to enhance value for Athabasca's shareholders by providing a clear path for self-funded production and cash flow growth in the Kaybob Duvernay resource play. Athabasca (Thermal Oil) and DEC have independent strategies and capital allocation frameworks. The primary strategic objective is to generate top-tier cash flow per share growth over the long term.2025 Consolidated Budget. Athabasca is planning capital expenditures of ~$335 million with average production of 37,500 - 39,500 boe/d (98% Liquids) and an exit rate of ~41,000 boe/d. Growth in production comes from the expansion plans at Leismer and development of the Duvernay assets.Cash Flow Per Share Growth. The Company forecasts consolidated Adjusted Funds Flow between $525 - $550 million1. Every +US$1/bbl move in West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") and Western Canadian Select (""WCS"") heavy oil impacts annual Adjusted Funds Flow by ~$10 million and ~$17 million, respectively. Athabasca forecasts generating ~$1.8 billion of Free Cash Flow1 from its Thermal Oil assets over five years (2025-29), representing ~65% of its current equity market capitalization. Investing in attractive capital projects and prioritizing share buybacks results in ~20% compounded annual cash flow per share2 growth through this forecast period. Financial Resiliency. Athabasca maintains a strong and differentiated balance sheet with a $135 million consolidated Net Cash position, including ~$335 million of cash. DEC has no debt and operates within its annual Adjusted Funds Flow and its balance sheet. Athabasca (Thermal Oil) also has $2.4 billion in tax pools, including $1.9 billion of immediately deductible non-capital loses and exploration pools, sheltering cash taxes until beyond 2030.

Athabasca (Thermal Oil) - 2025 Budget Highlights

Capital Program. The Thermal Oil budget is ~$250 million with activity focused primarily on advancing progressive growth to 40,000 bbl/d at Leismer by the end of 2027. The program at Leismer will include the tie-in of six redrills and four new sustaining well pairs on Pad 10 early in 2025, additional development at Pad 10 and 11, and continued facility expansion work. At Hangingstone two new extended reach sustaining well pairs (~1,400 meter average laterals) will be on stream in Q1 2025 and are expected to maintain annual production. The Budget includes routine maintenance at both assets.Production Growth. Annual Thermal Oil production guidance is 33,500 - 35,500 bbl/d. Leismer is expected to achieve 40,000 bbl/d by the end of 2027 at an attractive capital efficiency of ~$25,000/bbl/d. Hangingstone production will be maintained by utilizing existing plant capacity, resulting in capital efficiencies of ~$15,000/bbl/d. The Company has ~1.2 billion barrels of Proved plus Probable reserves and ~1 billion of Contingent Resource. These Thermal Oil assets underpin decades of reserve life with estimated sustaining capital investment of ~C$8/bbl (five-year annual average) to hold production flat.Robust Free Cash Flow. During the five-year time frame (2025-29), Athabasca (Thermal Oil) forecasts generating $1.8 billion in Free Cash Flow1, representing ~65% of its current equity market capitalization.Competitive and Resilient Break-evens. Thermal Oil is competitively positioned with sustaining capital to hold production flat funded within cash flow below US$50/bbl WTI1 and growth initiatives fully funded within cash flow below US$60/bbl WTI1. The Company's operating break-even is estimated at ~US$40/bbl WTI1.Exposure to Strong Heavy Oil Pricing. With the start-up of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in May, spare pipeline capacity is driving tighter and less volatile WCS heavy differentials. Regional liquids pricing benchmarks have also been supported by a depreciating Canadian currency relative to the United States. Every +US$1/bbl move in West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") and WCS heavy oil impacts annual Adjusted Funds Flow by ~$10 million and ~$17 million, respectively.Pre-payout Thermal Oil Differentiation. Strong margins and Free Cash Flow are supported by a Thermal Oil pre-payout Crown royalty structure, with royalty rates between 5 - 9% anticipated to last to the end of 2027 at Leismer and beyond 2030 at Hangingstone.

Duvernay Energy Corporation - 2025 Budget Highlights

Capital Program. The DEC budget is ~$85 million with activity including the completion of a 100% working interest (""WI"") three-well pad that was drilled in 2024 and the drilling and completion of a 30% WI multi-well pad. Activity will also include spudding two additional multi-well pads in H2 2025 (one operated 100% WI pad and one 30% WI pad) with completions to follow in 2026. DEC is also constructing strategic water and egress expansions on its operated assets.High Netback Production. Annual production guidance is ~4,000 boe/d (77% Liquids) with growth to ~5,500 boe/d by the end of 2025.

Development will be self-funded within DEC through utilization of 100% of its annual Adjusted Funds Flow and its balance sheet. The Company has self-funded growth potential to in excess of ~20,000 boe/d (75% Liquids) by the late 2020s1.

Return of Capital

100% of Free Cash Flow Directed to Share Buybacks. In 2025, the Company plans to maintain its commitment to return 100% of Thermal Oil Free Cash Flow to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2024, the Company has completed ~$280 million in share buybacks to the end of November. Share buybacks were initiated in April 2023 and have totaled ~$440 million to date. Focus on Per Share Metrics: A steadfast commitment to cash flow growth and return of capital has driven a 108 million share reduction (~17%) in the Company's fully diluted share count since March 31, 2023. The Company has realized ~100% cash flow per share growth since 2022 and the corporate strategy is to continue to generate top tier cash flow per share growth over the long term.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Also included in this News Release are estimates of Athabasca's 2024 outlook which are based on the various assumptions as to production levels, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and other assumptions disclosed in this News Release. To the extent any such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Athabasca and is included to provide readers with an understanding of the Company's outlook. Management does not have firm commitments for all of the costs, expenditures, prices or other financial assumptions used to prepare the financial outlook or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects of all of those costs, expenditures, prices and operating results are not objectively determinable. The actual results of operations of the Company and the resulting financial results may vary from the amounts set forth herein, and such variations may be material. The outlook and forward-looking information contained in this New Release was made as of the date of this News release and the Company disclaims any intention or obligations to update or revise such outlook and/or forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

To the extent any such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Athabasca and is included to provide readers with an understanding of the Company's outlook. Management does not have firm commitments for all of the costs, expenditures, prices or other financial assumptions used to prepare the financial outlook or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects of all of those costs, expenditures, prices and operating results are not objectively determinable.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Also included in this News Release are estimates of Athabasca's 2024 outlook which are based on the various assumptions as to production levels, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and other assumptions disclosed in this News Release. To the extent any such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Athabasca and is included to provide readers with an understanding of the Company's outlook. Management does not have firm commitments for all of the costs, expenditures, prices or other financial assumptions used to prepare the financial outlook or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects of all of those costs, expenditures, prices and operating results are not objectively determinable.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Insolvencies as an emerging D&O risk

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

Third-party litigation funding a growing exposure

The global litigation funding industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years -by almost 10% CAGR up to 2028 - widening access to justice, but also potentially driving up the number of class actions and settlement costs and damages, as also highlighted in Allianz Commercial's Five Liability Loss Trends To Watch report. And it is not only confined to the US - third-party litigation funding is also established in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.

""D&Os will face increasing scrutiny from third parties ready to jump on cases and fund them. Claims are likely to become more complex because of funders' aggressive litigation strategies and the experts they can afford to hire,"" says Schlesinger. ""Plaintiffs with little to lose financially could be tempted to make baseless claims. Even if the case doesn't have legs, directors still have to defend it.""

Challenges persist in Asia D&O market

The price-driven Asia D&O market has experienced a drop in overall premium rates during 2024, due to factors including high competition from an abundance of capacity globally, and challenging economic environments resulting in some clients reducing limits purchased to save costs.

""We foresee the overall market size for D&O in 2025 will continue to retract, driven by rate erosion, smaller limits being purchased by customers, and very limited new opportunities given slow capital market activities. Despite this, D&O insurance remains crucial for companies due to the multiple exposures executives face, and as loss potential increases with higher severity for claims being resolved,"" says Danielle An, Regional Practice Leader, Management Liability Commercial, Asia, at Allianz Commercial.

supply chain disruption,10 of the restaurant industry's most impactful bankruptcies of 2024,Restaurant Dive,https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/looking-back-at-2024s-restaurant-bankruptcy-wave/734528/,"While dozens of brands and operators filed for bankruptcy in 2024, a sample of major filings show a range of problems from rising labor costs to low traffic.

This year's myriad restaurant bankruptcies make it possible to draw many individual lessons about tactics that burdened balance sheets.

But if the filings of bankrupt brands and operators elucidate specific, flawed business practices, like Thai Union Group's sale-leaseback process at Red Lobster, are there generalizable lessons, given the sheer number of bankruptcies?

The short answer is rising prices. Restaurants raised prices 30% in five years, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics Data collated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, while overall prices went up 22% and grocery prices went up 27%. Eventually, many consumers pulled back. At the same time, capital became more difficult to raise starting in 2022, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. This tightened the money supply and increased the cost of borrowing money.

Strong brands and concepts, particularly fast casuals that offer significant perceived value, have done very well in this environment. But brands with weaker value propositions, worse unit economics and burdened balance sheets fell behind.

""Even in the best of times, there are still companies that are either stressed or distressed,"" Brad Sandler, a partner at the bankruptcy and restructuring law firm Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones, told Restaurant Dive.

Sandler said that consumer health overall is strong but that prolonged operational challenges in a thin-margin business like restaurants makes it difficult for companies with a lot of debt to turn things around.

Bankruptcies were more common in ""consumer-facing industries that have been adversely affected by the economy,"" Sandler said. ""From supply chain disruption to rising labor costs to geopolitical tensions there's been a tremendous amount of disruption.""

Local conditions impacted specific brands as well. Rising labor costs associated with California's $20 fast food wage helped seal Rubio's fate. Sticky's Finger Joint was hurt by particularly low foot traffic in Manhattan. Roti's bankruptcy was hastened by the end of rent deferral agreements. At One Table Restaurants, the parent company of Tender Greens and Tocaya, high commission fees on third-party delivery ate up much of the brands' recovery from COVID-19.

Franchisee bankruptcies, one of 2023's most alarming trends, continued apace this year. One Dickey's Barbecue franchisee filed for Chapter 11 protections as the chain's store system shrank. Arby's franchisee Miracle Restaurant Group went bankrupt in the summer after failing to find a buyer for underperforming units. And in casual dining, Louisiana Apple went bankrupt after a creditor sued and Applebee's stripped it of control of its stores.

supply chain disruption,TSMC in talks with Nvidia to make new AI Blackwell chips in Arizona,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tsmc-in-talks-nvidia-blackwell-chips-arizona/,"The final packaging of these AI chips still needs to be done in Taiwan because the Arizona plant lacks the required resources.

TSMC is in talks with Nvidia Corp to make the Nvidia artificial intelligence Blackwell chips at its new factory in Arizona.

According to a recent report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd is ready to begin production at the Arizona facility early next year. The information was revealed by three sources who asked not to be identified as these discussions are confidential.

US plants are part of efforts to limit supply chain disruption

Introduced in March, Nvidia's Blackwell chips have been manufactured in TSMC plants in Taiwan so far. Potential clients for these highly demanded chips are companies working in generative AI and accelerated computing.

Nvidia claims these Blackwell chips work 30 times faster than earlier models at tasks like providing answers for a chatbot. The company announced that it fixed design flaws in October.

If finalized, the deal will make Nvidia one of the major customers of TSMC's Arizona plant, which will begin large-scale production next year. Neither has commented on the update.

Recently, the U.S. has added more restrictions to limit China from accessing advanced tech used for semiconductor manufacturing on national security grounds. On the other hand, China has retaliated as well by limiting exports of key materials used in the production of chips.

TSMC's efforts to set up manufacturing plants inside the U.S. are part of the chip maker's strategies to minimize single-region dependency. The semiconductor giant is expanding operations in Arizona in part to ensure a more resilient supply chain for its clients, which also includes Nvidia.

Apple and AMD are also customers of TSMC's Arizona plant

Apple and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are among the clients of the Taiwanese chipmaker's Arizona plant as per two sources. Both Apple and AMD did not comment on the matter as well.

While the initial stages of the manufacturing of Nvidia's Blackwell chips will take place in TSMC's Arizona plant, the final packaging needs to happen back in Taiwan.

This is because the plant in Arizona does not have the advanced chip packaging technology known as chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) necessary to make Blackwell chips. All of TSMC CoW's operations so far are in Taiwan.

The world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, is pouring billions into the U.S. with three plants planned in Phoenix. The U.S. government is supporting these projects with large subsidies as part of a larger effort to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

supply chain disruption,Post-Brexit border delays threaten UK protected edibles growers and crop supply,FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/europe/article/9685132/post-brexit-border-delays-threaten-uk-protected-edibles-growers-and-crop-supply/,"The next 8 weeks is a short, but critical window in the UK Protected Edibles calendar, with growers importing seeds and/or young plants into the UK in preparation for next season's crop, ensuring supermarket shelves are well stocked with high-quality British produce in 2025.

British Protected Edibles Growers are extremely concerned about the new BTOM checking and testing regimes at the UK border, brought in earlier this year, which are already causing significant delays to seed and plants reaching their destinations, and rather than re-assure, raise serious alarms around plant health and biosecurity. The phytosanitary measures already taken in the protected edible cropping supply chain are exceptional, but we believe these measures will and are being compromised through the checks taking place at border control points (BCPs), jeopardizing the health and quality of seeds and plants reaching growers and posing undue additional risks to grower businesses.

Whilst as an industry we are working with partners including the NFU, Defra, APHA to resolve this, and productive conversations are being had, not enough is being done to allay these very real concerns or rapidly develop pragmatic, safe, and workable solutions. The checks being carried out at the border are not proportionate to the level of embedded biosecurity already in the protected edible supply chain, and the risks to crops are not being sufficiently mitigated.

Key concerns:

Changes to import regulations, following Brexit, and the need for additional processes including seed testing and plant checks/testing at BCPs, are resulting in significant delays in the release of seeds for sowing and plants for planting, thus causing major supply chain disruption to the UK-protected edibles industry. Regarding the plant inspections at BCP's, we have serious and founded concerns about inadequate biosecurity measures, cross-contamination risk, lack of careful handling and uncontrolled holding conditions. The protected edibles supply chain has a very effective, embedded biosecure supply chain from seed producers to propagators to grower nurseries, which is being inherently put at risk by these additional processes, and we have not been reassured that our concerns are being taken seriously. Seed houses have reported testing delays of over 6 weeks in some cases of batches being sent to the UK, primarily caused by the turnround times for additional plant pathogen testing (already carried out at source), which makes crop programming and planning extremely difficult, thus causing significant negative economic impact - the burden of which is primarily with UK growers. Seed of European origin is already tested and certified to an equivalent standard as disease free before being dispatched to GB, making additional testing in the UK an unnecessary, costly and t ime-consuming duplication. A reciprocal phytosanitary agreement with the EU would mitigate many of these delays in this respect.

supply chain disruption,Shippers eye alternatives as Indian port workers prepare for 'indefinite' strike - The Loadstar,The Loadstar,https://theloadstar.com/shippers-eye-alternatives-as-indian-port-workers-prepare-for-indefinite-strike/,"Indian shippers are braced for major supply chain disruption after dockworkers call for strikes at key ports, claiming the government is still falling short of commitments.

The Loadstar previously reported that a consortium of labour groups in India told port authorities workers would stage indefinite work stoppages across ports from 17 December, in protest at the lack of action to address long-standing labour concerns.

The unions today confirmed their promise of ""an indefinite strike"", should the government fail to implement wage revisions and productivity schemes before 15 December.

There are 12 government-controlled ports in India, but over the past decade privately owned ports, particularly in the container sector, have taken increasing amounts of market share - the Adani-owned port of Mundra has overtaken Nhava Sheva to become India's busiest container gateway. Similarly, Chennai has ceded a significant portion of its southern Indian containerised trade to nearby Adani facilities at Kattupalli and Ennore.

Co-founder and director of Kale logistics Vineet Malhotra told The Loadstar: ""As it is expected that only government ports might strike, and the private ports would still operate, shippers would mitigate by moving their shipments through the private ports as an alternative approach for the short-term.""

But Jitendra Srivastava, CEO of Triton Logistics & Maritime, warned that if many shippers shifted to private ports, this would lead to higher costs and delays in cargo handling and clearance. He advised shippers to explore alternative shipping routes and to consider air freight, particularly for perishables.

Indeed, Mr Malhotra also advised: ""In case of lighter cargo, shippers might end-up utilising the air freight mode.""

He added: ""The centre of all this will be technology enabled real-time monitoring, that will help shippers make quick adjustments.""

A productivity linked reward scheme remains at the heart of the impasse at the ports and needs to be approved by the federal government retroactively to 2021. With no guidelines in place, interim retirees from the ports have lost out on benefits, unions claim.

""The workers and pensioners are restless, and [they are] compelled to go on industrial action against the non-implementation of statutory settlements,"" the labour groups said.

According to IPA sources, the ministry of shipping needed to issue an order approving wage revisions for port workers, which ""has been delayed"", one official told The Loadstar last month.

Funding to cover additional overheads by the government ports, amid growing market share challenges from the private port sector, could be a major reason pushing the decision back at government level, according to industry observers.

Nonetheless, Mr Malhorta remained optimistic that negotiations during the 10-day countdown to a strike notice would ultimately prove productive.",,,,N/A,N/A,India

supply chain disruption,"Key Risk Trends For Directors And Officers In 2025: Insolvencies, Geopolitical Tension And ""AI washing"": Allianz",Brand Spur,https://brandspurng.com/2024/12/05/key-risk-trends-for-directors-and-officers-in-2025-insolvencies-geopolitical-tension-and-ai-washing-allianz-2/,"D&O market remains competitive but a step up in scrutiny of corporate conduct around the globe means loss potential is still high.

Munich, December 5, 2024 - Directors and Officers (D&Os) have been operating in a highly complex environment throughout 2024, and further volatility can be expected during 2025. Executives face multiple exposures in an increasingly interconnected business world, confronted with risks arising from business insolvencies, geopolitical upheaval, climate change, digital transformation, economic uncertainty, shifts in public opinion, and an evolving legal landscape. These are the latest key risk trends in the D&O insurance space, as identified by Allianz Commercial's annual Directors and Officers Insurance Insights report.

""The D&O insurance market has remained competitive for buyers over the past year, but loss potential is still high,"" says Vanessa Maxwell, Chief Underwriting Officer, Allianz Commercial. ""The global rise in business insolvencies is a particular focus of concern, with companies and leaders exposed to potential claims from lenders seeking to recover funds, or from shareholders who allege breach of fiduciary duty. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, and we are seeing regulatory bodies across the globe step up scrutiny of corporate conduct, making D&Os more vulnerable to investigations, penalties and lawsuits.""

Insolvencies as an emerging D&O risk

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to Allianz Trade. Major insolvencies already increased by +26% year-on-year for the first three quarters of 2024 (344 cases). Western Europe leads the global count with 195 cases, a reflection of the region's current economic instability, followed by Asia-Pacific (67 cases) and North America (66 cases). Rising bankruptcies typically lead to an increase in D&O claims, so this trend is a reminder to business leaders of the need to respond and adapt to the challenging environment.

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

supply chain disruption,Indonesian interest rate cuts seen to narrow in 2025,The Star ,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/12/05/indonesian-interest-rate-cuts-seen-to-narrow-in-2025,"JAKARTA: Bank Indonesia (BI) governor Perry Warjiyo has signalled that the central bank will have less room for continued monetary policy easing next year as pressure mounts on the rupiah as a result of the more inward-looking policy expected from the administration of United States president-elect Donald Trump.

""Global turmoil has pushed us to focus on rupiah stabilisation,"" Perry said in his keynote speech at the BI annual meeting in Jakarta last Friday, adding that BI's policy rate would be adjusted in accordance with ""global and domestic economic dynamics"".

He added that BI was continuing to look for room to cut its benchmark rates as inflation was expected to remain steady in the next two years and as lower interest rates were needed to drive economic growth.

Aside from changes to the BI rate, the central bank's toolbox to protect the rupiah includes foreign exchange market intervention and so-called macroprudential incentives, which are offered by BI to banks extending loans to priority sectors and small businesses in the form of lower reserve requirements.

Perry said Trump's return to office would ""bring big changes to the world's geopolitical and economic landscape"" that would dim the world's economy in the next two years, and he indicated how it pressed the central bank to act accordingly.

Speaking at the same event, President Prabowo Subianto said geopolitics was ""in a rather sensitive situation full of uncertainty, necessitating us to remain alert, always careful.

""But I am grateful that the overall situation in remains calm and conducive"".

Perry said import tariffs, trade wars, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and economic and financial fragmentation were adding to global uncertainty and would play out in various ways.

He said a slower and diverging economic growth, where the US would see better days while China and Europe would experience weakness.

Supply chain disruption and trade wars, Perry said, would see inflation pressure ""re-emerge"".

inventory optimization,How the Supply Chain Ecosystem Can Transform Your Operations,supplychainbrain.com,https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40680-how-the-supply-chain-ecosystem-can-transform-your-operations,"To tackle the complexities of modern supply chains, businesses are prioritizing agility, resiliency and sustainability, as they navigate rising transportation and freight costs, complexities in demand forecasting, and gaps in visibility.

Following are five megatrends that are currently at play across the supply chain ecosystem.

Green and circular supply chains. The importance of environmental compliance is driving the adoption of green supply chains, with sustainability an integral component. Enterprises are shifting to circular supply chains with increasingly distributed and interconnected networks of players, along with multidirectional flows of information, goods and money.

Reverse logistics. The prevalence of business-to-consumer deliveries emphasizes the need for logistics that involve managing returns and buying surplus goods and materials. The backward movement of goods from customers to sellers or manufacturers requires well-designed supply chains that are responsive to disruptions.

Micro supply chains, micro-warehousing and fulfillment. To accommodate the growing diversity and complexity of consumer demands, including the need for customization, businesses must deliver value without impacting costs. Micro supply chains are agile, small and decentralized operating models that optimize delivery systems and reduce the costs associated with the complexity and variety of products.

Visibility, traceability and location intelligence. Data is the critical component of supply chain operations. Visibility across a supply chain requires real-time insights on materials, orders, suppliers and products, to improve planning at a granular level, ensure efficiency, reduce disruptions and be able to make time-sensitive decisions.

Deglobalization of supply chains. Excessive concentration in certain markets and port congestions are leading to a drastic increase in inventory levels globally. To navigate this challenge and to build a resilient, long-term supply chain strategy, enterprises are considering the deglobalization of supply chains.

Businesses have achieved varied levels of digital maturity with the application of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and computer vision. They're using those tools to forecast orders, achieve end-to-end inventory visibility, and improve the reverse logistics experience. AI and ML-integrated models analyze both structured and unstructured data to streamline inventory and logistics management, warehousing, distribution and monitoring.

Recent developments in smart supply chains have driven innovation in predictive analytics, ML and computer vision. Service providers are investing in analytics to use data for improved planning and operations, and apply advanced algorithms in tandem with AI and ML-powered models across the supply chain. Over the years, providers have developed deep domain expertise that helps them spearhead evaluation scenarios to identify optimal operational metrics, and define micro-level segmentation to analyze and predict demand.

Innovations by leading analytics service providers include the following:

Next-generation control towers. Cognitive technologies such as AI, ML and intelligent automation have evolved supply chain control towers over the years to provide end-to-end visibility across every aspect of supply chain and logistics operations, mitigating inaccuracies caused by data silos. A comprehensive control tower strategy brings superior advantages in operational efficiencies and customer experience.

GenAI in supplier risk management. Service providers are drawing on the capabilities of generative AI to analyze diverse datasets such as historical information, market conditions, weather patterns and geopolitical events. Upon detecting possible risks within the supply chain, GenAI can rapidly generate insights, simulate scenarios to develop mitigation strategies, and assess and manage supplier risks.

Analytics-led cost optimization. Service providers are utilizing the large volumes of data generated by supply chains to identify patterns, glean insights and optimize operations budgets. They use a combination of prescriptive and predictive analytics to simulate scenarios for network optimization and improved cost efficiency.

Real-time monitoring through digital twins. Digital ""mirrors"" of entire supply chain networks continuously collect data from internet-of-things sensors and other sources. Embedded advanced analytics and AI enable more accurate and dynamic forecasting across inventory, contingency planning, distribution and logistics.

Scenario planning for demand sensing and forecasting. Real-time data and the use of advanced analytics are precursors to identifying and forecasting demand. Service providers monitor up-to-date information on changes in consumer behavior, weather patterns and economic conditions. They can generate ""what-if"" scenarios on future demand requirements and supply chain disruptions for contingency planning.

Geo-data analytics and route optimization. Service providers have invested in location analytics and intelligence to improve carrier networks, locate customers and analyze and understand the most popular products, services or stores in a particular area. This also enables businesses to plan and optimize routes, delivery times and locations. Last-mile delivery focus and route optimization algorithms reduce delivery costs and improve the customer experience.

AI-enabled inventory optimization. AI and ML models analyze large volumes of data, identify trends and patterns, and bring multidimensional intelligence to inventory management. Real-time inventory tracking is enabling enterprises to keep a check on their inventory and adjust as needed to prevent overstocking or understocking.

Businesses should consider whether they have the time, budget and talent to build and run the technology tools needed to achieve these outcomes. Many will find it makes sense to partner with one or more specialized supply chain ecosystem providers. Before turning to the outside, however, they should consider working with a third-party adviser to determine their business objectives, and align them with the right operating model and partner network to deliver desired outcomes.",,,,N/A,N/A,GenAI
inventory optimization,Self-flying AI drones are transforming warehouses and optimizing inventory management,WDSU,https://storystudio.wdsu.com/sponsored/self-flying-ai-drones-are-transforming-warehouses-and-optimizing-inventory-management/,"(BPT) - AI, drones, and e-commerce technology advancements, increasingly global supply chains, and today's instant delivery expectations are changing the way businesses manage their inventory. To meet and exceed customer expectations and effectively control costs, business leaders must constantly improve the tracking and accounting of product at physical locations to ensure counts are synchronized across e-commerce sites, backend warehouse management, and accounting systems. It is becoming increasingly critical for revenue growth and cost management for any retail, manufacturing, or fulfillment business, that inventory optimization is achieved through accurate forecasting, inventory cycle counts, and removing manual processes from the work of warehouse and logistics staff.

One recent publicly listed company, ZenaTech (Nasdaq: Zena), and its subsidiary ZenaDrone are set to lead the charge for this innovation. Their indoor self-flying or autonomous drones are transforming the inventory management and stocktake process by doing more accurate full physical counts of inventory as frequently as on an hourly basis. They are also changing the face of decision-making and planning particularly for ""available-to-promise"" (ATP) or ""capable-to-promise"" (CTP) forecasting and leveraging machine learning and predictive tools to automate and bring accuracy that can further improve the entire process.

Inventory carrying costs (ICC) are so important for any business to manage as they can eat significantly into the bottom line. Not just the actual product or material storage, but the associated handling costs, insurance, taxes, shrinkage, depreciation -- and the opportunity cost of having capital tied up in inventory. It is easy to see how quickly the costs of holding and storing unsold or work-in-process goods add up.

AI self-flying or autonomous drones are a modern way to help reduce ICC -- while also improving inventory management, stocktaking, and verifying the physical goods in your warehouse or storage facility, they also minimize labor costs.

This is one company to watch that addresses these problems directly and has a great future ahead.

Upgrade and innovate your inventory systems

ZenaTech's ZenaDrone has developed the new IQ Nano, a 10×10-inch drone designed to perform regular and frequent inspections including bar code or RFID scanning, facility maintenance inspections, security monitoring, 3D indoor mapping and other applications in a warehouse or distribution facility.

The IQ Nano is designed for autonomous use with integrated sensors, high-quality cameras, data collection and analysis, and AI capabilities. Weighing just 3.3 pounds and with a flight time of up to 20 minutes before autonomously touching down and recharging using its automatic battery charging station, the IQ Nano is designed for hovering stability and safety, thanks to its built-in obstacle avoidance capabilities.

""The IQ Nano is a breakthrough technology that dramatically reduces the burden of inventory management in terms of both labor and cost,"" said ZenaTech CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. ""This dramatically improves decision-making and efficient operations by being able to assess and manage physical inventory cost-effectively by the hour instead of once every quarter, as is often done. This easily results in inventory cost savings in millions of dollars per year for multi-warehouse facility customers.""

Transform your warehouse processes for a single facility or a network

Inventory management has become increasingly complex due to global facilities, information, and supply chains. According to Forrester research, omnichannel fulfillment across multiple stores, sales channels, and online marketplaces is a high or top priority for 94% of retailers. Ultimately, this is a much larger network than many traditional inventory management systems were designed to track and manage.

By adopting ZenaTech's ZenaDrone solutions, warehouse facilities can improve their operations and more easily account for inventory in addition to optimizing costs, compliance, and financial reporting:

1. Reduce costs and eliminate manual processes: Move from occasional or regular quarterly/annual stocktakes, to continuous inventory data, ensuring more accuracy and efficiency across the enterprise. This will boost productivity and cost reduction by eliminating the need for time-consuming and tedious manual counts.

2. Improve safety in the warehouse: Drones can reduce the need to climb up ladders and reach top shelves or other hard-to-reach areas, dramatically reducing safety issues and improving safety compliance.

3. Improve inventory carrying costs: Better accuracy knowing what is sitting in inventory or work-in-process for better decision making to lower overall inventory costs.

4. Instant identification of misplaced items: Swiftly identify and rectify misplaced pallets, boxes, and SKUs, streamlining picking, replenishment, and shipment processes.

5. Optimized goods tracking: Always know the exact location of goods, minimizing search times and maximizing resource utilization plus synchronizing with accounting systems.

inventory optimization,"AI-Based Innovations Propel Retail Profitability and Sustainability, Research Finds - Silicon Canals",Silicon Canals,https://siliconcanals.com/ai-based-innovations-propel-retail-profitability-and-sustainability-research-finds/,"Top Retailers Boost Profits 39% and Cut Carbon Intensity 21% Over Five Years, Fueled by AI and Connected Retail Advancements

LONDON & PALO ALTO, Calif.-(BUSINESS WIRE)-Retail Economics, an independent economics research consultancy focused on the consumer and retail industry, and SymphonyAI, a leader in predictive and generative AI SaaS products for the enterprise, today released results of new market research that shows powerful business impact from AI adoption. The research warned that data silo barriers to AI adoption are preventing laggard retailers from realizing transformational potential and underscores the importance of approaches like SymphonyAI connected retail to unify data and overcome operational silos for streamlined decision making and efficiency gains.

The research looked at the impact of AI in all major areas of retail, including merchandizing and marketing, demand performance, workforce productivity, store and space and sustainability and waste management. It found that the world's 200 largest retailers have boosted pre-tax profits by 39.4% and revenue by 31.3% over the past five years while also reducing their carbon intensity (CO₂e produced per $m of sales) by 20.9%. The study of more than 250 retailers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada revealed these gains came through technological investment, including predictive and generative AI. AI-based connected retail gives retailers dramatically increased operational efficiencies that both increase profits and reduce carbon consumption.

Connected retail gives users a seamless flow of AI-driven data and insights strengthening retail operations from the supply chain to the shelf. The Retail Economics research found that AI-driven efficiencies in inventory management, route optimization, and waste reduction have supported profit growth while reducing carbon intensity. Food retailers experienced the largest reduction in carbon intensity even as profit margins increased. Grocers use AI-based inventory optimization to prevent over- or under-stocking fresh items and significantly reduce costly and carbon-producing food waste.

Retailers believe the impact of AI on sustainability will accelerate over the next two years as they increasingly seek to boost operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability. Yet survey data reveals that the impact of AI across business functions in top retailers remains uneven as retailers apply AI in isolated operational areas rather than integrating AI across supply chains and operations. Data quality and availability are the primary hurdles to AI adoption, with access to high-quality, relevant data a major issue across most retail functions.

With the SymphonyAI connected retail platform and AI SaaS products, retailers gain a seamless flow of data and insights that empower optimized decision-making across every aspect of retail operations -- from the supply chain to the store shelf. SymphonyAI connected retail breaks down operational silos, so retailers can make swift, confident decisions without blind spots. Through a source-agnostic data onboarding framework, SymphonyAI connected retail delivers AI-driven insights across critical functions including customer behavior, sales, promotions, assortment, inventory, supply chain, and real-time shelf and store conditions, empowering retailers to enhance efficiency and profitability at every level. This unified approach enables:

""Connected retail is a must-have for retailers pursuing growth, profitability, and carbon footprint reduction,"" said Dusan Rnic, SVP international for the SymphonyAI retail-CPG division. ""Historically, retailers lacked the tools to unlock the potential of connecting all their functions due to data overload - which just happens to be the very essence of AI being successful. AI's potential to improve efficiency, customer engagement, and sustainability is not just a promise - it is now a reality and is a critical evolution in retail's journey. Retailers must consider unlocking AI's full potential, not only to lead in the current marketplace, but to support wider goals like sustainability.""

Richard Lim, CEO at Retail Economics, added, ""Leading retailers are demonstrating that investment in AI and technology can drive both profitability and sustainability. However, lagging companies risk missing out on AI's broader benefits if they don't prioritise data quality, system integration, and the right talent. By tackling these issues, retailers can achieve efficient growth that supports ambitious sustainability targets across key markets.""

Audits of the top 200 global retailers and consumer brands were conducted by Retail Economics using third party data and proprietary modelling, evaluating five-year trends in carbon emissions, profitability, and revenue to assess the relationship between financial and environmental performance.

Additionally, business surveys of over 250 retailers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada were conducted to understand the impact of AI, including priorities and challenges.

The research also surveyed over 7,500 consumers in the same regions, offering a shopper perspective on AI-driven retail experiences and priorities.

Impact of AI Across Business Functions: Cross-market Comparison (Graphic: Business Wire)

The research looked at the impact of AI in all major areas of retail, including merchandizing and marketing, demand performance, workforce productivity, store and space and sustainability and waste management. It found that the world's 200 largest retailers have boosted pre-tax profits by 39.4% and revenue by 31.3% over the past five years while also reducing their carbon intensity (CO2e produced per $m of sales) by 20.9%. The study of more than 250 retailers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada revealed these gains came through technological investment, including predictive and generative AI. AI-based connected retail gives retailers dramatically increased operational efficiencies that both increase profits and reduce carbon consumption.

Connected retail gives users a seamless flow of AI-driven data and insights strengthening retail operations from the supply chain to the shelf. The Retail Economics research found that AI-driven efficiencies in inventory management, route optimization, and waste reduction have supported profit growth while reducing carbon intensity. Food retailers experienced the largest reduction in carbon intensity even as profit margins increased. Grocers use AI-based inventory optimization to prevent over- or under-stocking fresh items and significantly reduce costly and carbon-producing food waste.

Retailers believe the impact of AI on sustainability will accelerate over the next two years as they increasingly seek to boost operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability. Yet survey data reveals that the impact of AI across business functions in top retailers remains uneven as retailers apply AI in isolated operational areas rather than integrating AI across supply chains and operations. Data quality and availability are the primary hurdles to AI adoption, with access to high-quality, relevant data a major issue across most retail functions.

With the SymphonyAI connected retail platform and AI SaaS products, retailers gain a seamless flow of data and insights that empower optimized decision-making across every aspect of retail operations-from the supply chain to the store shelf. SymphonyAI connected retail breaks down operational silos, so retailers can make swift, confident decisions without blind spots. Through a source-agnostic data onboarding framework, SymphonyAI connected retail delivers AI-driven insights across critical functions including customer behavior, sales, promotions, assortment, inventory, supply chain, and real-time shelf and store conditions, empowering retailers to enhance efficiency and profitability at every level. This unified approach enables:

Profit and Revenue Growth: Retailers using AI-driven tools experience optimized inventory management, precise demand forecasting, and improved customer engagement. Sustainability Gains: Food retailers using AI to reduce overstocking and waste have seen the largest reductions in carbon intensity while growing profitability. Operational Agility: Real-time insights enable swift, confident decision-making that adapts to changing consumer demands and market dynamics.

""Connected retail is a must-have for retailers pursuing growth, profitability, and carbon footprint reduction,"" said Dusan Rnic, SVP international for the SymphonyAI retail-CPG division. ""Historically, retailers lacked the tools to unlock the potential of connecting all their functions due to data overload which just happens to be the very essence of AI being successful. AI's potential to improve efficiency, customer engagement, and sustainability is not just a promise it is now a reality and is a critical evolution in retail's journey. Retailers must consider unlocking AI's full potential, not only to lead in the current marketplace, but to support wider goals like sustainability.""

Richard Lim, CEO at Retail Economics, added, ""Leading retailers are demonstrating that investment in AI and technology can drive both profitability and sustainability. However, lagging companies risk missing out on AI's broader benefits if they don't prioritise data quality, system integration, and the right talent. By tackling these issues, retailers can achieve efficient growth that supports ambitious sustainability targets across key markets.""

About the research

Audits of the top 200 global retailers and consumer brands were conducted by Retail Economics using third party data and proprietary modelling, evaluating five-year trends in carbon emissions, profitability, and revenue to assess the relationship between financial and environmental performance.

Additionally, business surveys of over 250 retailers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada were conducted to understand the impact of AI, including priorities and challenges.

The research also surveyedover 7,500 consumers in the same regions, offering a shopper perspective on AI-driven retail experiences and priorities.

By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. The press release and earnings presentation which management will speak to are available under the Investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com. We've also included a supplemental disclosure file in Microsoft Excel with key financial information.

Joining me for today's call are Sandy Douglas, our Chief Executive Officer; and Matteo Tarditi, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Sandy and Matteo will provide a business update, after which we'll take your questions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties.

These risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements.

I'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our press release and the end of our earnings presentation.

And finally, beginning with the second quarter, we plan to change the sales channels reporting on the face of our press release. To assist with the transition, we will provide the new basis for presentation and historical figures prior to the next earnings call. We believe these changes will give you additional insight and transparency into our multiyear strategy and sales performance.

I'd now ask you to turn to slide 6 of our presentation as I turn the call over to Sandy.

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

As we shared in our release, we delivered a solid start to fiscal 2025, which included revenue growth of over 4%, primarily resulting from positive volume growth in our wholesale business and improving adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, driven by actions to enhance our capabilities and drive efficiencies across the business. This performance led us to raise our full year outlook for all financial metrics other than capital spending.

Based on the progress updates I'll share momentarily, we also remain confident in our strategy and multi-year plan and our ability to deliver the financial objectives outlined in our October call, which we believe will lead to sustainable shareholder value creation. Now I'll go into more detail on the progress we made in the quarter, how it's helping the customer experience, and how we're working to become a more efficient partner and value creator for our suppliers and customers.

As we discussed on recent calls, we believe UNFI's scale; heritage; and natural, organic, and specialty products; and our expanding value-added services offering makes us uniquely suited to help retailers differentiate and compete in a highly dynamic and competitive environment. We can see these points of differentiation supporting many of our customers as they successfully execute their strategies in the marketplace.

In the quarter, our customer base contributed to volume growth above the gains reported by Nielsen for the supermarket space and helped strengthen our top line performance and expected trajectory. Volume gains in the quarter were about 2% compared to the prior year, and we've seen this positive trend continue into Q2.

Importantly, this performance indicates a solid start to the execution of our strategy, but it also demonstrates strong strategic execution by our over 30,000 store customer base, as we continue to sharpen our focus on providing differentiated products, programs, services and insights that help them compete effectively. To help extend this performance, we remain focused on strengthening service levels, simplicity, and transparency to our customers and suppliers while increasing efficiency across the business.

We know how important it is to deliver on time and full in the important holiday selling season and the whole company is focused on it. We also continue to roll out our revamped go-to-market program for suppliers, which aims to streamline and simplify their experience and help them accelerate their growth within our diverse retailer network.

Several of our large suppliers that have embraced the program have experienced volume gains that surpass their peer group as they've taken advantage of the data and insights we provide in areas such as new item placement or bringing items discontinued during COVID back on to customer sales.

We continue to focus on bringing additional suppliers into the program while making sure participants of all sizes have the best experience possible and are able to maximize the value and the growth opportunities that UNFI is making available to them. We will continue to execute our plan to pursue innovation in our offerings, optimize efficiency and strengthen service levels to help drive even greater value and trust with retailers as well as suppliers.

As we focus on becoming more efficient, Matteo's leadership has played a significant role in our progress. He has deep experience in helping turn around and improve businesses, largely through the disciplined implementation and rigorous follow-through of Lean Six Sigma management principles. This is already benefiting UNFI and our financial and operating performance.

I'll let him provide more color and details momentarily, but let me talk at a high level about a few of the actions that we've taken to improve the overall customer and supplier experience while removing cost and streamlining the organization. Reducing or eliminating waste is a big part of what we're trying to accomplish over the next three fiscal years.

With shrink reduction a big focus over the past five quarters, we brought shrink in line with historic pre-COVID levels, and we're now working to reduce it further, while simultaneously striving to increase the capacity of our network through ensuring that we have the right assortment, which should help drive higher sales for us and for our customers.

Decentralizing responsibility and accountability in the organization is another principle of Lean, as is the mutual development of key performance indicators that get measured and course corrected in near real time. As Matteo described on our last call, we've begun the process of pushing the Lean framework into our distribution centers, where local operators are involved in the process of creating and taking ownership of operational KPIs.

These same associates are at the center of problem-solving and creating action plans where performance is not meeting expectations. We piloted the process in two distribution centers and are pleased with the initial results.

Next, we'll begin further aligning our organization to deploy this methodology across more of our facilities. Our continued focus on network optimization has also proceeded as planned, and we have completed the closure of both our Billings and Bismarck conventional distribution centers, which we described last quarter.

We have retained the vast majority of the business from these DCs, which is now being serviced from nearby, more modern UNFI facilities with larger assortments. We are now marketing the real estate.

For similar reasons, we made the decision to close our Fort Wayne, Indiana distribution center and transfer that volume to neighboring facilities in Pennsylvania and Illinois, where we expect customers to see assortment and service level benefits. Associates and customers were informed of this in mid-November, and we expect to complete this move early in calendar 2025.

Fort Wayne is another owned DC, which will begin marketing at the appropriate time. We will continue to evaluate other similar optimization opportunities.

During the quarter, we also moved natural volumes from our York DC into our 50% larger, soon-to-be-automated Manchester DC, which we expect will yield service quality and efficiency benefits for our customers, suppliers and UNFI in the region. We can see the combination of adding value for customers and suppliers to support their sales alongside our efficiency focus, delivering tangible operating and financial improvement.

As we have combined above market sales volume with our improving efficiency, we've been able to increase net sales per employee by over 6% compared to the prior period, which is structurally improving profitability and free cash flow generation.

This is partially a result of growing sales driven by the success of our customer base and expanding customer relationships as well as our actions to enhance the responsiveness of our organization and empowering associates deeper in the organization to make real-time improvements.

All in, we drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 15% compared to the prior year first quarter and delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of sequentially improving adjusted EBITDA dollars. This progress reflects strong execution against our targets, and we will remain focused on executing at higher levels to continue to improve service levels, efficiency and free cash flow while reducing leverage.

As we execute, we become even more confident in our multiyear objectives, long-term trajectory and in our ability to add value for retailers and suppliers across the food retail ecosystem. We are focused on becoming the most efficient, value-creating long-term partner for our stakeholders, which in turn creates more opportunities for the approximately 28,000 UNFI associates who serve our customers with dedication every day. Together, we remain confident our plan will drive sustainable shareholder returns.

With that, let me turn it over to Matteo to discuss our Q1 results, Lean progress and revised outlook. Matteo?

Giorgio Tarditi

Thank you, Sandy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call.

As Sandy stated, we're off to a solid start in fiscal 2025 and remain confident in our multiyear strategy and the corresponding long-term financial objectives we outlined during our year-end call. Today I will provide additional insight into our first quarter results, including our free cash flow and capital structure, offer some early proof points around the initial success we've had with Lean principles and comment on our updated outlook for fiscal 2025.

With that, let's dive into our Q1 results. Turning to slide 8. Our first quarter sales came in at $7.9 billion, 4.2% higher than last year's first quarter. In wholesale, volumes were up nearly 2%, which represented another quarter of sequential acceleration and continuation of the trends we experienced as we exited fiscal 2024.

These volume increases reflected continued improvement across natural and conventional, with our natural business, again, seeing significantly stronger trends compared to the overall industry as well as expanded relationships with new and existing customers. Inflation was largely unchanged sequentially at about 1%, and down approximately 2 percentage points compared to the prior year quarter.

Total retail sales fell 3% year over year with ID sales down 1.4%, both lower declines compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was partly the result of targeted promotional investments made to drive store traffic, which began partway through the quarter.

Our team, in conjunction with the Cub franchisees continues to refine an operating plan expected to drive improving top and bottom line performance as we move further into the fiscal year. Moving to slide 9, let's review profitability drivers in the quarter.

Our gross margin rate, excluding LIFO, was 13.3% of net sales in the first quarter, down about 40 basis points compared to last year, driven by both our wholesale and retail segments. Our wholesale margin rate declined approximately 40 basis points versus last year's Q1 due to changes in business mix at both the customer and the product level, lower procurement gains and ongoing strategic commercial investments.

These were partially offset by progress driving innovation and efficiency, including through supplier programs and reduced shrink. One driver of our shrink improvement this quarter was our work around eliminating waste, a key principle of Lean management.

We've been successful in thoughtfully identifying and focusing our teams on several processes within our distribution centers where our expense ratio has creeped up following the period of COVID and broader supply chain challenges. Our actions have led to lower operating expense, increased capacity and more efficient workflows as well as reduced spoilage.

Retail gross margins were also below last year's Q1 levels, which, as I mentioned earlier, were driven by targeted price and promotional investments made to drive traffic, primarily at Cub. More than offsetting the decrease in gross margin rate was solid execution and management of our operating expenses, which, compared to last year, declined by approximately 65 basis points as a percentage of net sales.

As Sandy stated, we are focused on becoming a more efficient business that is better able to bring value and improving service levels to our customers and suppliers. This has led to consistent efficiency gains across our supply chain where we've generated sequential improvement in throughput for three consecutive quarters and a 5% improvement in cases per hour in Q1 compared to last year's quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter grew nearly 15% compared to prior year quarter to approximately $134 million. Absent the additional week in last year's fourth quarter, this was the fifth consecutive quarter of sequentially improving adjusted EBITDA dollars.

This increased adjusted EBITDA during Q1 was complemented by lower-than-expected costs associated with our accounts receivable monetization facility as well as some investment gains. Together, this more than offset slightly higher amounts for depreciation and amortization and net interest expense. This led to adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share compared to a net loss of $0.04 per share in last year's first quarter.

Flipping to slide 10. As I discussed on our last call, we are implementing Lean principles throughout our business and supply chain and are encouraged with the early operational improvement and financial results we have driven. One major undertaking that we have completed over the last few months is the decentralization of our procurement function.

We've transitioned from having one centralized procurement team to a DC-based organization, bringing them closer to our customers and operations. This has empowered teams to be more directly involved in demand forecasting, allowing for more timely and accurate inventory ordering.

While there have been some initial adjustments along the way, the team is embracing the process, learning and steadily driving improvement. We will continue to focus on driving sustained improvement in this area to help even better align demand with supply and to steadily increase customer service level, a core focus of our multiyear strategy.

The other initiative that I would highlight is the recently completed initial launch of Lean daily management routines and distribution centers in Texas and Colorado where measures of success were built around key performance indicators for safety, quality, delivery and cost, in that order of priority, all meant to create supply chain value for all UNFI stakeholders, including our suppliers and customers.

Initial results showed an 11% improvement in fulfillment quality, 5% improvement in on-time delivery and gains in warehouse labor productivity. As we move through fiscal 2025, we plan to scale Lean daily management processes methodically throughout our network while sustaining our focus on quality and value delivery.

Turning to slide 11. This emphasis on Lean principles helped drive profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow in Q1 was a use of about $159 million, roughly $170 million improvement over the past few fiscal years in which we used close to $330 million in the first quarter of each of these years.

This improvement included paying an incremental $56 million of incentive compensation in the first quarter, which was not paid out in the prior year due to the fiscal 2023 performance. Our first quarter progress were largely due to faster-than-anticipated progress on working capital management. This was partially driven through a shift in how and where we manage inventory.

The decentralization of procurement with the inventory management closer to the end customers, which is particularly important as we focus on the Q2 holiday selling season and delivering strong service to our customers. Because a portion of the year over year favorability is timing related, we would not expect to see the same favorability to last year for each of the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year.

Part of this is also driven by the nonlinear nature of the timing of the cash outflows for our supply chain and automation investments, which is captured in our updated full year outlook for free cash flow. Our Q1 free cash flow was also reduced by nearly $70 million from the strategic decision to reduce the number of customers under our accounts receivable monetization program.

As I suggested on our last call, this program was originally implemented to reduce our effective borrowing cost. However, the cost saving benefit no longer exist, and it makes it neutral from a cost of capital perspective relative to other funding sources.

Although we plan to lower our usage rate of these and similar programs, UNFI retains the flexibility to strategically utilize additional capacity should we choose to do so in the future. As is typical in Q1, our net debt levels increased sequentially and ended the quarter at $2.2 billion of net debt.

This contributed to our net leverage increasing by about 0.2 times of a turn to 4.2 times, which is towards the lower range of the typical historical increase we have seen during our first quarter as we prepare for the holiday selling season. This performance in Q1 keeps us on track with our longer-term deleveraging goals.

Looking at slide 12, fiscal 2025 is off to a solid start, and we're modestly raising our full year outlook for all financial metrics other than capital spending. As outlined in our press release, the updated guidance for net sales is a range of $30.6 billion to $31 billion, which represents a 1.3% full year increase at the midpoint compared to the fiscal 2024 when adjusting for the 53rd week last year.

This represents about an 80 basis points increase in dollar terms from the midpoint of our prior outlook. We have raised the bottom end of our expectations for adjusted EBITDA by $10 million, bringing the new range to $530 million to $580 million, which is a 9% increase over the last year at midpoint.

In terms of cadence for the year, we expect first half adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to the prior year period. This implies total adjusted EBITDA generation will likely be slightly back-half-weighted, reflecting the cadence of actions we're executing as part of our revised strategy and how this builds into results over the balance of the year.

Including the benefit of lower forecasted interest expense and a couple of small below-the-line items, our EPS and adjusted EPS ranges have increased as well with adjusted EPS now expected to fall within the range of $0.40 to $0.80 per share compared to $0.14 last year. Full year free cash flow is now expected to be more than $100 million, which compares to our prior outlook of approximately $100 million, and represents around $200 million in improved year-over-year free cash flow.

As Sandy mentioned, we have completed the closure of both our Billings and Bismarck distribution centers and retained the vast majority of the business, which is now being serviced out of nearby facilities. We're in the process of marketing the real estate underlying both properties, but we will not sacrifice value for time which is the same philosophy we will apply for the Fort Wayne closure and future sale.

As I said in the last quarter, we will continue to evaluate other opportunities along these lines, but have not included any incremental strategic actions in our outlook. Flipping to slide 13, we enter fiscal 2025 with a stronger foundation and operating momentum, which continued through the first quarter of the new year.

Our efficiency initiatives, powered in part by Lean principles, are generating the operating benefits we expected while our volume trends reflect the successful execution of our customers as well as the trust they place in us every day. Our strategy of bringing value to our customers and suppliers through a differentiated value proposition and strengthening service levels while improving UNFI free cash flow is simple and powerful, and we are executing against it.

Sandy, myself and the entire leadership team remain confident and optimistic about our future and the value creation opportunity we have as we work to improve our capabilities and customer-facing execution. Our focus on delivering and deleveraging remains intact, and we look forward to updating you on our progress again next March.

With that, operator, please open the line for questions.

(Operator Instructions) John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Partners.

John Heinbockel

Sandy, I want to start with decentralized procurement. Maybe just talk about balancing, right, you want to manage the inventory locally, but you want to buy it with the benefit of scale. So how you're managing that?

And then when you think about accountability is great, but if you can write alter your or make the compensation program -- make changes there to strengthen accountability, what do you want to do on the compensation side that might be different?

J. Alexander Douglas

John, as we said on the call, a key tenet of our strategy is adding value to our customers and suppliers. And a big part of that is having the products that they need delivered to their stores in a timely fashion. And overall, with those goals in place, we're focused on delivering strong customer fill rates, and we've set the goal of reducing our inventories back to pre-COVID levels within the scope of the multiyear plan.

We view this in some respects, like the shrink goal we've been pursuing over the past five quarters, and we see significant opportunities for improvement both in working capital and in service. Part of achieving better working capital efficiency, as you know, is moving the decision-making and the view closer to the store so that our associates can be involved in the forecasting and the analysis.

And we expect the change to better serve customers and to be a more efficient partner. And we're always looking for ways to align compensation directly with the outcomes that we're seeking in the business. I'd also say that this is early days in this process.

We're continuing to refine the model to make sure that it delivers exactly as it's designed and it's consistent with the Lean principles that Matteo has brought to the company.

John Heinbockel

And maybe as a follow-up, I think you mentioned 5% improvement in cases per hour. I believe that was the number. Now you didn't give what the result was in the two DCs. So I'm curious, I mean, you should see improved productivity beyond that, right, as you roll out Lean. Is that fair?

And when you think about time to -- we implement day one, when do you hit your stride on focus on productivity? Is that -- is it six months out? Is it a year out? Is it longer? What's the timeline?

Giorgio Tarditi

John, it's Matteo. As we discussed in the last call, our goal is to target in between MSD and HSD productivity at our DCs, and that is through a combination of the Lean principles that we're deploying, as well as the benefits and the learning from the automation efforts.

So it's a balance of the two. Specifically at the two distribution centers where we piloted Lean daily management with safety, quality, delivery, cost KPIs, we're seeing the 11% improvement in fulfillment quality, 5% improvement in on-time delivery and also some benefits from a productivity standpoint.

But bear in mind that these are six to eight weeks old initiatives, so there is a lot to ramp up there. And the framework of 6 to 12 months between the deployment of Lean daily management to the other DCs and the learning and the ramping of the automation initiatives is the right framework, and that's how we're thinking extracting $150 million of cost from the roughly $4 billion of total costs from the business in the next three years.

Your updated sales guide implies a deceleration for the balance of the year on a comparable 52-week basis. Just if you could walk us through how you're thinking about inflation and volume as drivers for the balance of the year, underscoring that.

Just surprised, given the new business wins this quarter, that you called out volumes coming in a bit better than expected. Why should that not flow through in a bigger way for the remainder of the year?

Giorgio Tarditi

Leah, thanks for the question. So in the first quarter, we saw volumes growing about 2% in wholesale, delivering total growth of 4.2%. And that was a trend that we picked up in fiscal (inaudible) as you recall, and carried into the early innings of the second quarter.

So we are thinking about the new guidance, which is now at midpoint, $30.8 billion rounding as basically a roughly 1% growth for the remaining nine months of the year, that is balancing three dynamics. One is the strength that we continue to see with our natural customers.

Second is the more modest volume declines that we've seen in conventional. And then third, the ongoing dynamics with the DC optimization. So as Sandy mentioned, we're able to retain the vast majority of our customers in Billings and Bismarck.

We're now going to go through a similar experience with Fort Wayne. And we feel that the balance for the remaining nine months is, again, embedding no risk and no dynamics, but also the strength that we see with the natural business.

And again, the more modest declines that we are seeing in conventional. And we keep the overall commercial backdrop front and center as we think about the execution for the remaining nine months.

Leah Jordan

And then just on a related follow-up, just digging a bit more to the new business gains this quarter driving some of that volume. Which categories are presenting the most opportunities for you now?

And then why do you think these same customers, existing customers are more engaged now? Or how do you think you're resonating more today?

J. Alexander Douglas

Leah, this is Sandy. I guess one of the things that's most interesting about the broader environment is how segmented and differentiated retailers are performing very, very well. I'll give you an example. Multicultural focused customers in many markets are materially outperforming the general market by their differentiated offer and the way they compete.

And obviously, we're focused on providing great support for them as well. You've seen the natural organic performance driving significant growth as well. And so as we think about the way we show up, is making sure that we have the product services and programs that retailers need to drive their strategy.

And inside the shop, there's a lot of growth in fresh. There's -- we mentioned natural products and multicultural products. But we're also bringing professional and digital services that are helping customers compete as well.

I want to ask about the gross margin rate contraction in the quarter, and if you could give us any sense of the outlook there? At least sequentially versus the last couple of quarters, at the end of last year, last fiscal year, there was a pickup in that gross margin contraction.

So you've talked about some of the things that could contract it, let's say, our commercial investments, customer mix and things that were helping with shrink, and other things. Could you just dive a little deeper into the quarter, why the contraction might have been greater than it was?

Why it was greater than it has been? And what's the outlook to the extent you're willing to talk about that?

Giorgio Tarditi

Andy, the gross margin rate in the first quarter at slide 4 was 13.3% versus 13.7% in Q1 of last year and down about 20 basis points or so versus the fourth quarter. Now, notably, it grew $7 million and contributed to $7 million of the $17 million of EBITDA growth.

And if you unpack the $7 million, we actually saw about $13 million of growth in wholesale and a decline related to volume in retail. There are a lot of drivers that go into the gross margin rate, and we commented that the two key drivers were planned customer and product mix, which were partially offset by the improvement in shrink and supplier programs.

Also bear in mind that some of the large customer mix pressure has some offset in OpEx with fewer and lower drops as, again, we scale up our facilities. I would highlight that the -- we continue to be very focused on improving the margin rate, including further shrink improvement.

As Sandy mentioned, we're back to the pre-COVID levels, but we embrace Kaizen and continuous improvement there. We're focused on growing our professional and digital services business that clearly give us some additional calories on the gross margin, as well as private brands, and committed to grow both top and bottom line for retail.

We're also reworking and revamping our commercial screening process, as we commented in the last call. So within the $90 billion resilience space, we continue to look for opportunities to create and get recognition for value with customers and suppliers. So we're very focused on the gross margin conversion and increase in the gross margin conversion as we see sales growing.

On the other side, we're also pleased with the fact that we delivered substantial operating leverage with top line up 4%, operating expense has been down 65 basis points as a percentage of sales, all put into a 15% growth in EBITDA.

Andrew Wolf

Great. I appreciate that granularity. So it sounds like the gross margin rate contraction was much less so, obviously, in wholesale, even though -- I mean, it was more in line with the sales growth. And I think as you spoke to, there was some investment in retail, which I guess, to get the same-store sales improving. And that's why retail gross margin was down year over year, gross profit dollars?

J. Alexander Douglas

I think that's right, Andy. This is Sandy. I would also point out that our retail business grew its EBITDA by $1 million versus prior year also. So it's a part of a rebuild and a strategy that our franchises are -- our franchise community in the Twin Cities is working with our retail leadership to galvanize the brand.

And so we're investing some in price to be more competitive, but we're funding it through the operations. And we're, I would say, optimistic, but early days of the retail turnaround in the Twin Cities.

Andrew Wolf

And if I can ask a much longer focused question, if I will. I think the Lean processes are -- sounds like they're gaining traction pretty rapidly in labor productivity and other efficiencies. But they're pretty new. So I think it's quite reasonable to assume that it's the rightsizing of headcount reduction and less facilities that really is driving the lower operating expenses as adjusted.

And what I really want to get to is, will that mix change over time, when you start heading to the back end of -- the second half to the back end of the fiscal '27 guidance, is it going to be more of the Lean processes that really start to drive labor operating expense efficiencies, more so than I would imagine upfront?

J. Alexander Douglas

Andy, let me do the first half of this and then I'll let Matteo dive into the way the Lean process works. But I would call out on our strategy four key components. The first is organic growth driven by a very resilient $90 billion segment of the industry, a segment where we're seeing retailers grow and a segment where we are designed as a company to serve in a differentiated way.

Secondly, the focus on value added to customers and to suppliers is a key component for how they compete and win, and we're designing products and services and programs to do just that. All of that creates the top line engine and then, clearly, efficiency is a huge component in a $30 billion company with our margins and with the strategy to grow our operating margin sequentially as a core part of value creation.

It's going to be important that we're incredibly efficient. Our customers need us to be -- or suppliers do, and so do our shareholders. And then the final component, optimizing free cash flow is a critically important element as we deleverage the company back to lower levels that we committed to in the three-year plan.

And so I view it really capability-wise as sales and merchandising meeting lean management principles to drive a virtuous cycle. And Matteo, maybe lay out the sequence for Lean as we go forward.

Giorgio Tarditi

Yes. Thank you, Sandy. We are really focused on two areas at the moment from a Lean standpoint. The first one is to deploy Lean daily management as a way to create quick problem-solving and countermeasures at the point of impact. That's why we selected two distribution centers to pilot.

We have a few more implementing the Lean daily management, and we're also embracing it in the functions. The second area is waste elimination, identifying nonvalue-added steps as a way to create capacity, build capabilities and build efficiencies. And that is a process that takes a lot of discipline and probably longer horizons.

But we are very, very focused on applying this methodology as a way to create value and efficiency for our customers and suppliers while remargining UNFI and generating the free cash flow to get to 2.5 times or less leverage by the end of 2027.

This is Ben Wood on for Kelly. I want to start with, first, how is the demand for your services tracking? And where are we in the evolution of some of those programs and offerings? Previously, UNFI had disclosed it was about 20% of EBITDA, which we believe may be a little closer to 30% plus given where EBITDA is expected now. Is that fair? And where do you see services growing at and mixing to longer-term?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. I think we shared that number in beginning of fiscal '22. And at the time, we described services and brands as being a little bit more than 20% of our EBITDA. We've said in less specific ways over the last couple of years that they continue to outgrow the company, and that is certainly our strategy for those businesses.

And I put them into three buckets. There's the professional services that help retailers save money and run their stores, their digital stores that help them modernize their tech stack and begin to attract investment like the early days program we've built around the retail media network.

And then Brands Plus is a broad strategy that we have to fit segmented brand portfolios to different retailers' brand sets. And a good example of that is our natural and organic portfolio, which is growing from mid- to -- mid-single to mid-double digits from a growth perspective.

So we still don't disclose the operating segment as a special segment, but it's a meaningful part of our profitability and even more meaningful part of our growth.

Ben Wood

Great. And then following up on your last point there, Sandy. With some of the success, and it seems pretty drastically different in the natural and organic categories and channels, are you seeing more interest from other parts of your wholesale universe to adopt some of those offerings and put them into their assortment? Are any of your customers trying to chase volume growth by adding more natural and organic categories?

J. Alexander Douglas

I think it's broadly a consumer trend that better-for-you and healthier products are gaining traction, and we're certainly going to follow what our customers want to do from a product and merchandising standpoint. So I think your assumption is right.

The interesting thing that I mentioned earlier, though, is that the whole proposition that the retailer brings is important to their winning. And being in our business, we're in the support business of customers, whatever they're positioning.

And I do think the presumption of your question that natural, organic and specialty products are important is a good one. And certainly, we're seeing that.

Ben Wood

Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, if I may here. Where are we in the rollout of the simplified fee structure? What proportion of your customers are on that? And what's some of the main pushback you're hearing to a faster adoption to that?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. And I think what you're referring to is our supplier go-to-market program and simplified supplier approach. We're well into the rollout of that. The supplier go-to-market program is for large suppliers. It's a customized program.

We're well into the second year of that. And we've seen some really compelling results from suppliers who have been early adopters. The simplified supplier approach, which is for all of our suppliers, takes 15 to 20 fees and eliminate them and replaces them with a single subscription.

And that one has been broadly adopted across the smaller suppliers. I would say where are we in the maturation of the process, I'd answer it two ways. First is we're learning a lot, as our suppliers, and we're working hard to make the tools more accessible and easier.

But I think in the process of the dialogue, we have learned that we have an opportunity more broadly to work on the supplier experience. And we have a whole-of-company effort, that Matteo and I review every week, to improve key aspects of the supplier experience to take friction out, to add transparency and to help our suppliers succeed with the program you asked about, but more broadly in our ecosystem.

Because it's important to our customers that we have the best brands and brands that are comfortable because they can see their business in our ecosystem and they can invest to grow. And so that's why it's such a big priority of ours to improve their experience.

Congrats. Actually, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of those points. And maybe just a bit more on the supplier go-to-market programs, and I think you provided some examples just how successful this has been for certain suppliers, which sounds pretty impactful, so curious on that. And then just how that feeds into your business and profitability specifically.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. I think I'll try to give you a couple of examples so that whether one would be a big supplier and one would be a smaller one. And obviously, I won't name the suppliers, that's up to them to do. But one very large supplier was part of the pilot.

And they brought the strategic objective of trying to capture 35,000 unique SKU retail store distribution opportunities that had fallen off during the supply chain disruption during COVID. And we built an effort to build programming for our retailers that would create the opportunity for retailers to access those brands and get a launch program that the supplier had built.

And we got about 95% of the way to the goal, and it taught us what we could do in that area. And so that's now a part of some of the other customized programs, to help retailers make sure they've got the right products that they want to have, not just the ones they had when the ones they wanted to have ran out. And so that's been a big initiative there.

For smaller suppliers, I think the biggest tool we've given them is the ability to see their sales through our system into retail, which, with that data, they can then target their programming and work with our sales force to try to make sure that their brands are doing as well as possible, particularly in stores that are growing.

And so I would describe the whole thing as a learning process. Early days. The benefit to UNFI is we make slightly higher fees on the bigger suppliers, approximately the same on the medium. And then we still keep fees low, but it's one fee, not 15 to 20.

So it allows suppliers to be able to plan and execute. And as I said earlier in my broader answer, we view the supplier experience as a strategic opportunity for improvement, and we're in very much the early innings. But we're taking action on a weekly basis to try to do it better.

Alex Slagle

That's helpful. And earlier, you mentioned natural and organic portfolio growth and sounded -- mentioned mid-double digits, maybe I got the number wrong, but if you could just clarify what you have commented.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. And no, I said all of that, and it probably was confusing. I was thinking about the three platforms within our natural private brands portfolio. And one of them happens to be growing mid-single, one of them is growing about 10 and one of them is growing about mid-teens. So they're three different brands.

Nice quarter. When you're talking about the new customers, how much of this is business coming back to you that might have been lost during the most difficult parts of integrating the SUPERVALU acquisition?

And how much of it might be getting towards the goal of selling more organic to conventional customers and more conventional product to organic customers prior to the original goal? It's a complex question, but trying to get a sense of where the new business is all coming from.

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes, Chuck. The simple answer is that the majority of the major gains is extending our relationship with existing customers. And it's all across the board based on what they're buying from us. We're seeing some natural customers tap into us for specialty portfolios.

We recently had a large natural customer who decided to take conventional products from us. So it really does vary by customer type. I would say if you were to say what's the direction it usually goes, it's usually us expanding natural organic or specialty into customers that don't have all three.

That would be the largest opportunity that we're activating. You don't see as many situations where conventional products go into natural retailers. In fact, you almost never do. So hopefully, that gives you some dimension on what the pipeline is.

Chuck Cerankosky

On the conventional side, where the volume has actually slipped, Sandy, how do you see that playing out going forward, especially if the economy stays where it's at where it was a lot of pressure on budget-constrained consumers?

J. Alexander Douglas

Yes. What I'd say, Chuck, is it's very hard to paint a brush very far in retail. There are predominantly conventional retailers that are extraordinary brands and are growing very well. You see that with some of the big chains around the country but that are regional.

As I mentioned earlier, predominantly conventional products, but multicultural focused retailers are putting up some of the best numbers in our system. I think the big challenge, and the place where we have work to do with our retail, and there are others that do as well, is the more centrally positioned retailers getting a strategy that's sharper and more differentiated, at least as it's compared to the big discounters.

Right now, the discounters have a fairly substantial price advantage and they're gaining share. And so there's a whole lot of work being done by the balance of the industry to find points of difference and to execute well to improve the value proposition.

Chuck Cerankosky

All right. Thank you very much. Good luck for the rest of the year.

So I was wondering if you can give us, it sounds like you're going to give us a different revenue layout next quarter. But I was wondering if you could maybe frame for us the revenue percentage associated with the legacy UNFI and the legacy SUPERVALU?

J. Alexander Douglas

I believe we have provided that publicly. It's basically half and half.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. And Sandy, how integrated are the businesses? I know we used to talk about, this is a few years ago now, like one bill, one truck, like how integrated are the facilities? How integrated is -- are the two businesses at this stage?

J. Alexander Douglas

The fulfillment systems are not particularly integrated. And the simple reason is that the SKUs are very different. You typically have much higher velocity SKUs in the conventional system, very often full truckload deliveries. Whereas in natural, you can find a much wider range of slower-moving products with smaller drops and multi-drop routes.

And so heretofore, largely because of the interruption that COVID happened, but we've been focused on making those systems work very well. And that's where the Lean process is now engaged. And it's why we speak so optimistically about the potential of Lean because of the work ahead.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. And I'm sure I could dig through filings and stuff like that, but what facilities have you been closing? Are those legacy UNFI or legacy SUPERVALU?

J. Alexander Douglas

They're all three of the ones that have been closed, that Matteo mentioned, Billings, Bismarck and Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne has not yet closed, are all legacy SUPERVALU warehouses. The York closure that moved over to Manchester for 50% more square feet is a Natural building, but we're automating that building.

And that's all being done for growth reasons. It gives us a chance to capture what has been a DC that was operating almost at 180% of capacity. We're now able, with the automation, to continue to drive significant growth in the Mid-Atlantic market for Natural.

Giorgio Tarditi

Scott, all three of them are owned. So as we mentioned, we are starting the process to remarket these three properties.

Scott Mushkin

And the idea there, Matteo, is obviously to pay down debt with those funds?

Giorgio Tarditi

Number one, two and three priorities, that's our capital allocation methodology.

We are in the process. We are not going to trade time for value. So we expect one of them to probably give us some proceeds by the end of fiscal '25 and the other two in the 2026 timeframe.

Scott Mushkin

Okay. Is there anyone else in the queue, or can I have one more?

Okay. So and again, this is something that I know goes back a long time, I think we've talked about it a little bit off and on. But to get cleaner here with the business, it would be nice to get rid of retail, in my mind.

Like where is your head around that, Sandy, and Matteo? Like is that a possibility? I know it's so complicated up in the Twin Cities, but is that something that could go back on the table?

J. Alexander Douglas

And I think, Scott, this is what I said last time. Everything is on the table from the standpoint that if we see a way to create more value for customers and suppliers and our shareholders, most importantly, in this case, we're going to be looking hard at it.

What I would say about retail is Cub is the number one food store brand in the Twin Cities. It's not only owned by UNFI, it's also owned by many of our customers up there. And there's a lot of positive energy for what we can do with Cub even though it's been soft for a couple of years.

And so put all that sales and profit in one place, and it's very linked together from a customer ecosystem standpoint, it's not an easy thing to divest by itself. So the best strategy for us going forward is to keep it together and drive performance.

And that's the plan that the franchisees and we have. But never say never. Obviously, we're going to do what's best for our shareholders.

This is Matthew Rothway on for Mark Carden. You had mentioned on the previous earnings call that you have a goal of achieving another $150 million of cost efficiencies this year. Would you be able to share any more on your outlook there and where we might be able to see that show up?

Giorgio Tarditi

Yes. So what we mentioned in the last call is that part of our three-year strategic plan is to remargin the business with about $150 million of cost out to incremental margins, which as you think about is a similar envelope as we deliver in 2024 as we had a lower exit run rate.

And through a lot of discipline and a lot of efforts, we were able to achieve the $580 million of EBITDA for the year. So we are encouraged by the first quarter. We have about $1 billion of total cost to manage every quarter, and we reduced the OpEx by 65 basis points from 13.5% a year ago to 12.9% this quarter.

And we're really leveraging two or three key principles. The first one is Lean daily management and the identification of waste to find new capacity and new capabilities. That is already finding routes and benefits in throughput and productivity.

We were better in throughput in the last three quarters sequentially and improved 5% year over year. And then we continue to work on a more decentralized organization that allows more effective decision-making and also leaner teams. And we have been able to reduce the total number of employees by 5%, which is also a return to the transformation and severance investments that we made in 2024.

We do that also offsetting some of the higher rents and some of the higher running costs, as you would imagine. So I think that first quarter, as Sandy said, is early innings, but it's a good proof point of our ability to control what we can control.

And knowing that through that high single-digit EBITDA growth that we provided for the next three years, we have a lot of variables under our control. And so we need to continue to apply Lean, continue to be disciplined and provide more proof points.

Operator

I'd now like to hand back over to Sandy Douglas for closing remarks.

J. Alexander Douglas

Thank you, operator. As you heard on today's call, we've made progress executing our multiyear strategy and have early proof points that the strategy is taking hold and creating value for our customers and suppliers while making UNFI a more effective and efficient organization.

We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of improving adjusted EBITDA including mid-teens growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period and meaningfully improved free cash flow compared to the first quarter of prior years. Our increased outlook reflects this performance and our confidence for the balance of the year.

We remain focused on the large opportunity for further improvement and are committed to getting better every day so we can be a clear value creator for customers, suppliers and, in turn, our shareholders. We've embraced Lean management and remain on a path to deliver improving service levels and the longer-term financial objectives we've set for ourselves.

For our customers and suppliers, we thank you for your continued partnership and the business we do together. For the UNFI associates listening today, our thanks to each of you for everything that you do for our business, our customers, our communities and each other.

And for our shareholders, we thank you for the trust you continue to place in us. Thanks again for joining us this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress in March. And we hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday season.

Operator

I'm adept at designing solutions for accurate materials data, real-time stock insights, and robust supplier relationship management, which are crucial for effective supply chain management.

SAP Ariba

As an SAP Ariba consultant, I'm skilled in sourcing, procurement, and supplier management within the Ariba platform. I have facilitated clients in implementing Ariba solutions that allow for streamlined procurement processes, efficient supplier collaboration, and improved sourcing capabilities. My work in Ariba includes designing sourcing events, enabling contract management, and configuring catalogs and procurement workflows. This expertise allows organizations to achieve cost savings, enhance compliance, and improve supplier transparency. Additionally, I've worked on spend analysis, leveraging Ariba's reporting capabilities to drive informed, strategic purchasing decisions.

Q.3: Could you elaborate on your experience with SAP implementation?

A: My experience with SAP implementation has spanned several projects across different modules and industries, focusing on optimizing business processes and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. Here's an outline of my expertise in SAP implementation:

Project Preparation and Blueprinting

In the initial phases, I work closely with stakeholders to identify project goals, establish a project plan, and define the scope of work. During the blueprinting stage, I conduct workshops with end-users and key stakeholders to understand the existing processes, gather requirements, and outline the specific SAP functionalities that will best align with the organization's goals. This foundational work sets up a clear roadmap for a successful implementation, with attention to regulatory compliance, industry standards, and client-specific needs.

Configuration and Customization (SAP MM and SAP Ariba)

I am highly experienced in configuring SAP modules such as Materials Management (SAP MM) and SAP Ariba for sourcing and procurement. For SAP MM, my configuration work includes inventory management, procurement processes, and invoice verification. In SAP Ariba, I set up sourcing events, supplier registration workflows, and contract management. Where necessary, I customize workflows and document formats to ensure that all components fit seamlessly into the client's existing processes, balancing out-of-the-box functionality with custom development.

Data Migration and Integration

During SAP implementations, I have managed data migration processes, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data between legacy systems and SAP. This involves designing data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) protocols, using tools like LTMC and custom ABAP programs to cleanse, migrate, and verify large volumes of transactional and master data. I also have experience with integrating SAP systems with external applications, such as logistics, third-party ERPs, and external procurement platforms, to provide a holistic data flow across systems.

Testing, Training, and Go-Live Support

A significant part of my role involves rigorous testing of the configured SAP solution, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). I create detailed test scripts and involve end-users in the UAT phase to ensure all functionalities perform as expected and meet the business requirements. Additionally, I lead training sessions and develop documentation for end-users and administrators to ensure that they are comfortable and proficient with the new system before going live. I provide go-live support to address any issues in real-time and to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to business operations.

Post-Go-Live Support and Continuous Improvement

Post-implementation, I remain involved in support and optimization activities, addressing user concerns, troubleshooting issues, and applying adjustments based on end-user feedback. I also conduct periodic reviews to identify areas for further enhancement, implement additional features, and keep the system aligned with evolving business needs. My continuous improvement efforts are geared toward maintaining the long-term value and relevance of the SAP solution within the client's operations.

Cross-Industry Experience

Throughout my SAP implementation projects, I have worked across various industries, such as retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, each of which has unique operational needs and compliance standards. This diverse background allows me to bring an adaptable, informed perspective to each project, applying industry-specific insights to deliver solutions that support growth, compliance, and competitive advantage.

In summary, my SAP implementation experience is comprehensive, covering the entire project lifecycle from planning and design to post-go-live support. My focus is on creating scalable, efficient, and user-friendly SAP systems that empower clients to streamline their processes, achieve greater visibility, and make data-driven decisions.

Q.4: How do you ensure effective project management and team collaboration?

A: Ensuring effective project management and team collaboration requires a combination of clear communication, strategic planning, and leveraging the right tools and practices. Here's how I approach it:

Establish well-defined project objectives and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

Break down the project into manageable phases with milestones to track progress effectively.

Clearly communicate roles, responsibilities, and expectations to all team members.

Develop a comprehensive project plan, incorporating timelines, resources, and risk assessments.

Utilize agile methodologies or traditional project management frameworks based on the project requirements. Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess project health and progress.

Foster a culture of regular and open communication through stand-up meetings, progress updates, and collaborative tools. Utilize communication platforms like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or SAP Collaboration tools to ensure all stakeholders remain informed.

Use project management tools like Jira, Trello, or SAP Project Systems to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and manage timelines. Encourage the use of document-sharing platforms for real-time collaboration on deliverables.

Q.10: How do you see the future of technology impacting your field?

A: The future of technology is poised to transform the fields of IT, procurement, and supply chain management in profound ways. Here's how I envision it impacting my area of expertise:

AI and Machine Learning: Technologies like predictive analytics and AI will enable organizations to anticipate demand, optimize procurement strategies, and reduce waste. For instance, procurement platforms such as SAP Ariba and tools like Celonis will increasingly use AI to identify patterns, risks, and opportunities in real time.

Advanced Spend Analytics: With more sophisticated analytics tools, organizations will gain deeper insights into spending behavior, enabling strategic sourcing and better cost control.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA): RPA will automate routine tasks such as purchase order creation, invoice processing, and vendor onboarding, freeing up teams to focus on strategic activities.

Smart Contracts and Blockchain: Blockchain technology will likely redefine vendor relationships and contract management by providing secure, transparent, and automated processes for executing agreements.

Scalable Systems: Cloud-based ERP and procurement solutions like SAP Ariba will continue to dominate, allowing organizations to scale operations quickly and access data globally.

Remote Work Enablement: Tools for collaboration, such as Teams and Ariba Network, will integrate more deeply with ERP systems, enabling seamless remote operations and decision-making.

Green Procurement: Technology will play a vital role in tracking and reporting on the environmental impact of procurement decisions, encouraging more sustainable sourcing practices.

Circular Economy Tools: Solutions will emerge to support the circular economy, ensuring products are reused, recycled, or remanufactured efficiently.

IoT and Real-Time Monitoring: The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable better tracking of inventory and shipments, leading to improved inventory accuracy and reduced transit times.

Dynamic Pricing Models: With advanced forecasting tools, companies will adjust procurement strategies dynamically based on market trends, ensuring cost-effectiveness.

As technology advances, the need for robust cybersecurity in procurement systems will grow. Tools that monitor and protect sensitive vendor and financial data will become indispensable.

Intuitive Interfaces: Platforms like SAP will prioritize user-friendly experiences, integrating AI-driven assistants to guide users through processes.

Tailored Solutions: Customizable procurement and ERP systems will adapt to the unique needs of industries and businesses, offering greater flexibility.

Global Vendor Networks: Platforms like SAP Ariba will continue to expand, fostering greater collaboration across global supply chains and enhancing transparency and accountability.

inventory optimization,SAP BrandVoice: Santa's Sleigh: A High-Tech Marvel That Means Business,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/12/09/santas-sleigh-a-high-tech-marvel-that-means-business/,"Ever wondered what makes Santa's sleigh the envy of every tech mogul?

Buckle up, because we're diving into the magical, high-tech world of Santa's sleigh -- an engineering marvel that requires meticulous care and maintenance to ensure a smooth ride on Christmas Eve.

Forget your traditional wooden sleigh; Santa's ride is a polymorphic alloy masterpiece. This bad boy is lighter than a feather and tougher than the wild turkeys strutting outside my window the day before Thanksgiving. With a ceramic coating that could rival NASA's space shuttle, this sleigh is built to withstand the extreme temperatures of flying faster than the speed of light.

He also makes sure that he leverages the latest technologies such as the estimated thousand plus IoT sensors to measure to create a digital twin of the sleigh. This ensures that the elves in Christmas Central have a real-time view, of how it is performing on Christmas Eve.

And let's talk power! Santa's sleigh is powered by ""eight tiny reindeer"", each one trained like an Olympic athlete. But that's not all -- Rudolph isn't just the leader because of his shiny nose; he's also the sleigh's built-in GPS! Who needs Google Maps when you have a reindeer with a glowing red beacon guiding the way?

I also hear that this year, Santa is leveraging a digital co-pilot that leverages AI to optimize route planning in real time.

With this tech, Santa can focus on what really matters -- delivering joy and the smiles on the faces of ""children of all ages""!

Behind every successful sleigh ride is a dedicated team of elves working tirelessly in Santa's workshop. These little helpers are akin to pit crew members at a Formula One race, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Equipped with mobile devices, they check everything from sleigh runners to Rudolph's harness, making sure everything is in tip-top shape.

In preparation for Christmas Eve, Santa disperses his ""little helpers"" to strategically located Maintenance and Distribution Centers worldwide. These centers leverage inventory optimization strategies and the latest collaboration tools to ensure that they are stocked with the right spare parts and gifts, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice. If something goes wrong mid-flight -- like a reindeer getting tired or a sleigh malfunctioning -- these elves are ready to jump in faster than you can say ""Ho Ho Ho!""

EHS (Elf health and safety) is paramount at the North Pole. The elves undergo rigorous training to ensure they're ready for anything -- like dodging rogue drones delivering holiday packages or managing last-minute gift requests. And let's not forget about the reindeer! They receive regular health checks to ensure they're fit for duty. If one gets tired, another can swoop in to save the day -- talk about teamwork!

This year, Santa has taken things up a notch with AI technology that would make Tony Stark proud.

Imagine an AI system that monitors how much energy (or magic) each reindeer contributes during flight! This system helps Santa optimize his team for maximum efficiency, ensuring Rudolph and his friends are fueled up and ready to go without running low on magic mid-flight.

Santa can even change his route on the fly based on weather patterns or last-minute naughty and nice list updates -- all thanks to predictive analytics and AI-driven decision-making. With this tech-savvy approach, Santa can deliver presents faster than you can say ""Jingle Bells.""

Thanks to those estimated thousand-plus IoT sensors installed throughout the sleigh, Christmas Central can monitor Santa's progress in real time. If the sleigh is malfunctioning, or a part is predicted to fail, those elves will spring into action. They'll send him a quick message: ""Hey Santa, take a left at Greenland and head in for a running repairs!""

So, there you have it! Behind every jingle bell you hear on Christmas Eve is not just holiday magic but also an incredibly sophisticated operation that combines engineering marvels with high-tech wizardry. With careful planning, advanced technology, and a dedicated team of elves and reindeer, Santa's sleigh is ready for action every Christmas Eve.

Next time you hear those jingle bells ringing through the night sky, remember that it's not just Santa flying through the air -- it's a well-oiled machine (or rather, a well-maintained sleigh) making its way around the globe.

So as you cozy up by the fire this holiday season, raise a glass of eggnog to Santa and his high-tech sleigh -- because nothing says ""Merry Christmas, and to all a good night"" quite like an AI-optimized ride through the night sky!",,,,N/A,N/A,"AI, Greenland, Santa"

Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-drink-firm-celsius-set-193537181.html,"Needham analyst Gerald Pascarelli initiated coverage on Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) with a Buy rating and a price target of $38.

The analyst says that as the third-largest player in energy drinks, CELH is positioned to benefit from a healthier category rebound and growing demand for zero-sugar products, creating a favorable environment for revenue acceleration alongside easier year-over-year comparisons.

The analyst writes that while the company recently saw its first year-over-year share loss, they are encouraged by the category's return to a high single-digit growth rate.

If this trend continues, CELH stands to benefit from a healthier market backdrop, easier comps, and upcoming innovations planned for 2025, adds the analyst.

Additionally, inventory optimization challenges appear to be resolving, which should improve alignment between sell-through and reported results.

The analyst estimates full year 2024 revenue and EPS of $1.365 billion and $0.68 and $1.548 billion and $0.93 in fiscal year 2025, respectively.

Last month, the company reported third-quarter earnings per share of $0.00, missing the street view of $0.04. Quarterly sales of $265.70 million (down 31%) missed the analyst consensus of $267.11 million.

An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages - like Celsius Holdings's page for example - there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.

These are known as capital allocation programs. Celsius Holdings does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.

For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 14.2%, you'll need to buy a share of Ellington Residential by the Dec. 31, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.08 on Jan. 27, 2025.

Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized.

inventory optimization,Q3 2024 Dollar General Corp Earnings Call,Yahoo! Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2024-dollar-general-corp-064104613.html,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and Kelly Dilts, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News and Events.

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.

Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third-quarter execution particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams work diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas. In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross, donating gift cards and through our own employee assistance Foundation.

We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later, but importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities, and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead. For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate.

Turning to our third quarter performance. On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter and also grew market share in nonconsumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item.

Customer traffic also increased 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October, and was positive in all 3 periods of the quarter. Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month.

While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior. We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value, and we are working hard to deliver for them every day.

We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted throughout the third quarter, and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year. With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our back-to-basics work which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenient proposition, we believe over the longer term, we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value.

Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.

Kelly Dilts

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points.

This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact. Now turning to SG&A.

As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months. While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement.

Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million, compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%, and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits, offset by the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes.

Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year, and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well.

We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in-stock levels and drive sales, while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52%, as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter. Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives.

During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding, for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter, as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs. Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1%, and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%.

These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of 5 fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90.

This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations.

Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa 2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance, and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress. To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.

We're confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.

Todd Vasos

Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our back-to-basic efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago, and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and looked at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain. We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience.

With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits.

And more importantly, our customers are telling us, as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores. This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores.

All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates. We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year, and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF.

Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points, and in full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplified the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates. In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity, and in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities.

We exited four more facilities in Q3, for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs. Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping the stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains.

I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility. Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year, we began the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth.

We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items storewide during the holiday season.

And a low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1. To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year. As Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease, and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year.

And we are well on our way to meeting that goal, with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms. Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50%, compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas, and we believe we are well positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward.

I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers. And then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March. First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter.

This pilot launched in September, and we're currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores, and the learnings from that initiative, and our own customer work, have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering with our unique customer base. We believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General, while still providing the value they need. We are quickly learning and refining our process, and over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers.

Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience to Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025. With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within 5 miles, or less, of approximately 75% of the US population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America.

As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year. More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels, while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the US, 2,000 full remodels, and an additional 2,250 project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations.

And we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico. With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average.

We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate, and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion, and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer-facing areas in the store. Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels.

And in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores. As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to the mature store base, cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable. Cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025.

I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20% plus. As we discussed, for our '24 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General branded stores in the US. As we said before for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities.

And nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box, and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products, and we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year is in the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth.

In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan. and we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025 as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders. As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.

With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman

My question is on the comp algorithm. How does it move now that you're mixing to a higher level of remodels versus store growth? It sounds like you could get almost a point of remodeled lift, assuming they continue to grow at the rate you expect over the next few years. Where does the comp algorithm land? And then consequently, if it's a little lower than what DG is used to, does -- how much does the cost structure need to evolve?

It sounds like you're making progress in a lot of areas. Some of the supply chain may take a little bit longer, but can you match that cost structure so that you can deliver some of the former earnings growth prior to the last couple of years?

Kelly Dilts

Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate, that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do. Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move the year.

So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target.

Had you seen enough progress with improved execution as well as the mitigation in shrink for for you to see line of sight to restoring double-digit EPS growth in 2025 despite having some incentive comp recurring next year?

Todd Vasos

Michael, this is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on back-to-basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March. But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had.

Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right. We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can. So we'll continue to work hard, not only on back-to-basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward.

So Todd, have you seen any notable change in consumer spending or behavior between consumables and discretionary from your low-income customer? Maybe could you talk to top line trends that you've seen in November, maybe relative to same-store sales in the third quarter? And then, Kelly, just with the heightened promotional backdrop, I think you cited, now expected at least through year-end. How best to think about gross margin puts and takes in the fourth quarter, maybe notably marked down?

Todd Vasos

I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you a very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3. So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf.

As a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our nondiscretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store. A matter of fact, value that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet.

And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope. We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side.

It's just -- she's been very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween. So -- not the candy side while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday.

And while there's a lot of selling left and unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in.

Kelly Dilts

Yes. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant. And that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it.

On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we're capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that. The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses.

And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations. That didn't really change much. And neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages.

So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4.

Todd and Kelly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the same-day delivery pilot. What have you learned so far from there? How much of that cost your consumer, if they would like the added convenience of that program? And how are you thinking about the margin implications, either passing on the cost of that to the consumer or absorbing those? And just kind of big picture thoughts about what that could add to the DG kind of growth profile going forward?

Todd Vasos

Yes. Thank you for the question. We're excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2. And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running.

I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating towards it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly. And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us, one, we want convenience. Two, we want an opportunity to always save money.

And then third -- believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that, comes specialized offering. So we're able to also offer that through this through this delivery means.

The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores. It could (inaudible) very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there.

and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time. We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it.

And with that comes low cost to both our customer the Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others. So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering. We're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network.

And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece. And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top line and bottom line perspective will produce for Dollar General.

So I just wanted to go towards FY25. Any initial puts and takes you can provide? I know your incentive comp could normalize. There could be some hurricane expense benefit. And including that, any initial thoughts on CapEx spend just given the significant increase in real estate products anticipated next year?

Kelly Dilts

Yes, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will pressure on 2025. The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries.

So we're seeing -- and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect -- it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025. And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the CapEx, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation.

I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we're expecting right now is a CapEx that would be similar to this year's CapEx as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects.

I wanted to circle back on the remodeling side of things. Moving a two-part question. One, I believe you historically mentioned that the DGTP remodels had an 8% to 11% comp sales lift that compares to the 6% to 8% you were mentioning today. So has there been any update on that front? And secondly, in terms of the mix of remodels versus new stores going forward, is 2025 a good model for the next couple of years as we think about the medium to longer term?

Kelly Dilts

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right. We had quoted 8% to 11% last year.

What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler accounts, and so that impacts top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns. So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns.

So anytime you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts.

Todd Vasos

Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base, and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base. We're excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come.

We're just starting the journey. But the great thing about the Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, they'll see in this project elevate. So excited about it. We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025.

Todd, you had mentioned last quarter that of the share gain that was up for grabs at the time that you didn't quite get your fair share, I know there's still been quite a few door closures in Q3 and we were wondering if you've seen any change with what you've seen with those opportunities this quarter?

Todd Vasos

Yes. Interestingly, we -- what we've seen is a little bit of a rebound of that. Matter of fact, our mid- to high-end consumer, we gained share once again in Q3. So happy to see that start to bounce back. So it's interesting how the consumer is reacting.

She's being a little finicky. But at the end of the day, value always wins. It appears -- and so she's starting to seek more and more value. So good to see that customer that's available out there in the marketplace that we were able to capture more of our fair share this quarter than we did last. And we've got our sights set on that.

Very same type of dynamic as we move through Q4 here and into early '25.

Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the actual dollars going into the standard remodels versus Project Elevate, and also what the return profile -- actual return is, as you calculate it? I know it's probably a little early on Project Elevate, but curious if you could give color on both of those.

Kelly Dilts

Yes. So for our traditional remodels, we're expecting a similar investment on the capital expenditure side. And I would tell you on Project Elevated is significantly less than that. So that's why it fits really nicely into our capital allocation structure. On the returns, we will -- you're right on Project Elevate a little early, but I will tell you that what we are contemplating are IRRs that are significantly higher than our new store IRRs and are relatively in line with the traditional remodels.

I wanted to focus on the gross margin. The trend is improving, down less this quarter than prior quarters. As you think about some of the tailwinds such as shrink on paper that should build into the fourth quarter and into next year, can you speak about that? And how you're thinking about gross margin expansion year-over-year starting in the fourth quarter? And maybe just in general, how you think about the recoverability of the gross margin from here?

Kelly Dilts

Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well. So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but I just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey.

And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financials statements just because as we take inventory through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there.

So historically, when your core customers been pressured, it's usually resulted in higher traffic, but lower ticket as folks buy less become in more frequently. Today, we're seeing the opposite happen with traffic dropping in the last few quarters. Todd, why do you think that is playing out that way? And would you expect that to change at some point?

Todd Vasos

Yes. We are squarely focused as always on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from [LY] So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously.

But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we're never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch. The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well.

So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's been very, very frugal with that spend. And when she spends it. So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1.

Curious when you do a remodel, how much of that expected comp lift is traffic versus conversion versus ticket? And then second, on that shrink opportunity and the gross margin line, I'm curious if there's an offset on the SG&A line? And then, Kelly, maybe just high level, how you're thinking about SG&A leverage point for next year?

Todd Vasos

Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yes, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, it -- your uptick happens from the offering itself. So more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds.

So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels.

Kelly Dilts

And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically a 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term.

Todd, just how are you thinking about the company's operating margin structure over time? It looks like if we back out the hurricane costs, you're going to exit this year a little bit around 5%. Can you improve on that over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like the business needs to see some investments both from labor and maybe price before you build from there?

Todd Vasos

Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we're pleased where we came out here in Q3. As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there.

We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about '25 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do. Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respective -- how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point.

I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there. And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned, that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?

Kelly Dilts

Yes. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time. We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns.

And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction. We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about and delivery could certainly play a big role in that.

We've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital. Supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today, and then, of course, our save-to-serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow which does allow us to invest in the business, and you saw that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project to Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth.

So while we're not ready to commit to a time line -- of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution, particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams worked diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas.

In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross, donating gift cards and through our own Employee Assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later. But importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities, and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead.

For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate. Turning to our third quarter performance.

On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter and also grew market share in non consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item.

Customer traffic also increased 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October, and was positive in all three periods of the quarter.

Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior.

We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value, and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted throughout the third quarter, and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year.

With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our Back to Basics work, which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenience proposition, we believe over the longer term, we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points.

This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact.

Now turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months.

While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points.

Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits, offset by the effect of certain rate-impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89.

Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total non consumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well.

We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in-stock levels and drive sales, while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter.

Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding, for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs.

Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1%, and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of 5 fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin.

We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting Back to Basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.

We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations.

Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately three times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance, and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress.

To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We're confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our Back to Basic efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and looked at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain.

We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment.

We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits. And more importantly, our customers are telling us, as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores.

This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate.

We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year, and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF.

Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points and in-full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplified the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates.

In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity and, in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited four more facilities in Q3 for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs.

Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping to stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility.

Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year, we began the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year.

Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items storewide during the holiday season and a low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1.

To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year, as Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year. And we are well on our way to meeting that goal, with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms.

Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50%, compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward.

I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers. And then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March.

First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September, and we're currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores, and the learnings from that initiative and our own customer work have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering with our unique customer base. We believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General, while still providing the value they need.

We are quickly learning and refining our process and, over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience of Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025.

With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within 5 miles or less of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America. As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year.

More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels, while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels and an additional 2,250 Project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations, and we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico.

With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format, which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average.

We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate, and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer-facing areas in the store.

Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels. And in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores, and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores, while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores.

As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio, including: performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20% plus. As we discussed, for our '24 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General-branded stores in the U.S.

As we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities. And nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box, and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products.

And we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year is in the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth.

In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan. And we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025, as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders.

As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Simeon Gutman -- Analyst

Hey, good morning, Todd and Kelly. My question is on the comp algorithm. How does it move now that you're mixing to a higher level of remodels versus store growth? It sounds like you could get almost 1 point of remodel lift, assuming they continue to grow at the rate you expect over the next few years. Where does the comp algorithm land? And then consequently, if it's a little lower than what DG is used to, how much does the cost structure need to evolve? It sounds like you're making progress in a lot of areas.

Some of the supply chain may take a little bit longer, but can you match that cost structure so that you can deliver some of the former earnings growth prior to the last couple of years?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate, that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do.

Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move through the year. So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Lasser -- Analyst

Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Have you seen enough progress with improved execution as well as the mitigation in shrink for you to see line of sight to restoring double-digit EPS growth in 2025 despite having some incentive comp recurring next year?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah, Michael. This is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on Back to Basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on, that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March.

But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work, because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had. Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right? We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can.

So we'll continue to work hard, not only on Back to Basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.

Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. So, Todd, have you seen any notable change in consumer spending or behavior between consumables and discretionary from your low-income customer? Maybe could you talk to top line trends that you've seen in November maybe relative to same-store sales in the third quarter? And then, Kelly, just with the heightened promotional backdrop, I think you cited, now expected at least through year-end. How best to think about gross margin puts and takes in the fourth quarter, maybe notably markdown?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you, very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3.

So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf, as a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our nondiscretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store.

A matter of fact, Value Valley, that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter, as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet. And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being -- the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope.

We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side. It's just she's being very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween.

So not the candy side, while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday. And while there's a lot of selling left and unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant, and that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that it's probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it.

On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we're capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro-neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that.

The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses. And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations.

So that didn't really change much, and neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages. So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Kelly Bania -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Todd and Kelly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the same-day delivery pilot.

What have you learned so far from there? How much of that cost your consumer if they would like the added convenience of that program? And how are you thinking about the margin implications, either passing on the cost of that to the consumer or absorbing those? And just kind of big-picture thoughts about what that could add to the DG kind of growth profile going forward?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Thank you for the question. We're excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2.

And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running. I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating toward it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly.

And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us: one, we want convenience; two, we want an opportunity to always save money; and then third, believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that comes specialized offering.

So we're able to also offer that through this delivery means. The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores.

It could marry very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time.

We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it. And with that comes low cost to both our customer and to Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others.

So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering, we're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network. And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece.

And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top line and bottom line perspective will produce for Dollar General.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh -- Analyst

Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go toward FY '25. Any initial puts and takes you can provide? I know your incentive comp could normalize. There could be some hurricane expense benefit.

And including that, any initial thoughts on capex spend just given the significant increase in real estate products anticipated next year? Thank you.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will put pressure on 2025.

The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries. So we're seeing -- and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025.

And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the capex, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation. I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we're expecting right now is a capex that would be similar to this year's capex as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.

Zhihan Ma -- Analyst

Hi, Todd and Kelly. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the remodeling side of things. Maybe a two-part question.

One, I believe you historically mentioned that the DGTP remodels had an 8% to 11% comp sales lift. That compares to the 6% to 8% you were mentioning today. So has there been any update on that front? And secondly, in terms of the mix of remodels versus new stores going forward, is 2025 a good model for the next couple of years as we think about the medium to longer term?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right.

We had quoted 8% to 11% last year. What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler counts, and so that impacts the top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns.

So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns. So any time you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base, we're excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come.

We're just starting the journey. But the great thing about Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, we'll see in this Project Elevate. So excited about it.

We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Seth Sigman -- Analyst

Hey. Good morning, everyone.I wanted to focus on the gross margin. The trend is improving, down less this quarter than prior quarters. As you think about some of the tailwinds such as shrink on paper that should build into the fourth quarter and into next year, can you speak about that? And how you're thinking about gross margin expansion year over year starting in the fourth quarter? And maybe just in general, how you think about the recoverability of the gross margin from here? Thanks so much.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well.

So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but I just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey. And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take a full year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financial statements just because as we take inventories through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there.

The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Scot Ciccarelli -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So historically, when your core customer has been pressured, it's usually resulted in higher traffic but lower ticket as folks buy less but come in more frequently. Today, we're seeing the opposite happen with traffic dropping in the last few quarters. Todd, why do you think that is playing out that way? And would you expect that to change at some point?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. We are squarely focused, as always, on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from LY.

So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously. But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we're never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing for more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch.

The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well. So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's being very, very frugal with that spend and when she spends it.

So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1.

Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lejuez -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks, guys. Curious when you do a remodel, how much of that expected comp lift is traffic versus conversion versus ticket? And then second, on that shrink opportunity on the gross margin line, I'm curious if there's an offset on the SG&A line. And then, Kelly, maybe just high level, how you're thinking about SG&A leverage point for next year.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yes, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, your uptick happens from the offering itself, so more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category, because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds.

So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically. A 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term.

Operator

Our final question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.

Chuck Grom -- Analyst

Thanks. Good morning. Good progress. Todd, just how are you thinking about the company's operating margin structure over time? It looks like if we back out the hurricane costs, you're going to exit this year a little bit around 5%.

Can you improve on that over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like the business needs to see some investments both from labor and maybe price before you build from there?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we're pleased where we came out here in Q3.

As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there. We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about '25 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do.

Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respective how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point. I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there.

And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than, obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time.

We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction.

We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about, and delivery could certainly play a big role in that. We've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital, supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today.

And then, of course, our Save to Serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow, which does allow us to invest in the business. And you saw that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth.

So while we're not ready to commit to a time line or, of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution, particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams worked diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas.

In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross, donating gift cards and through our own Employee Assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later. But importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities, and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead.

For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate. Turning to our third quarter performance.

On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter and also grew market share in non consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item.

Customer traffic also increased 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October, and was positive in all three periods of the quarter.

Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior.

We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value, and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted throughout the third quarter, and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year.

With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our Back to Basics work, which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenience proposition, we believe over the longer term, we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points.

This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact.

Now turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months.

While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points.

Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits, offset by the effect of certain rate-impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89.

Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total non consumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well.

We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in-stock levels and drive sales, while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter.

Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding, for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs.

Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1%, and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of 5 fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin.

We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting Back to Basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.

We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations.

Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately three times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance, and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress.

To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We're confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our Back to Basic efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and looked at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain.

We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment.

We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits. And more importantly, our customers are telling us, as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores.

This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate.

We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year, and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF.

Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points and in-full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplified the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates.

In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity and, in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited four more facilities in Q3 for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs.

Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping to stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility.

Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year, we began the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year.

Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items storewide during the holiday season and a low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1.

To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year, as Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year. And we are well on our way to meeting that goal, with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms.

Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50%, compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward.

I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers. And then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March.

First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September, and we're currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores, and the learnings from that initiative and our own customer work have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering with our unique customer base. We believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General, while still providing the value they need.

We are quickly learning and refining our process and, over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience of Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025.

With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within 5 miles or less of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America. As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year.

More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels, while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels and an additional 2,250 Project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations, and we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico.

With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format, which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average.

We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate, and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer-facing areas in the store.

Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels. And in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores, and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores, while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores.

As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio, including: performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20% plus. As we discussed, for our '24 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General-branded stores in the U.S.

As we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities. And nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box, and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products.

And we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year is in the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth.

In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan. And we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025, as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders.

As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Simeon Gutman -- Analyst

Hey, good morning, Todd and Kelly. My question is on the comp algorithm. How does it move now that you're mixing to a higher level of remodels versus store growth? It sounds like you could get almost 1 point of remodel lift, assuming they continue to grow at the rate you expect over the next few years. Where does the comp algorithm land? And then consequently, if it's a little lower than what DG is used to, how much does the cost structure need to evolve? It sounds like you're making progress in a lot of areas.

Some of the supply chain may take a little bit longer, but can you match that cost structure so that you can deliver some of the former earnings growth prior to the last couple of years?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate, that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do.

Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move through the year. So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Lasser -- Analyst

Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Have you seen enough progress with improved execution as well as the mitigation in shrink for you to see line of sight to restoring double-digit EPS growth in 2025 despite having some incentive comp recurring next year?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah, Michael. This is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on Back to Basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on, that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March.

But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work, because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had. Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right? We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can.

So we'll continue to work hard, not only on Back to Basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.

Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. So, Todd, have you seen any notable change in consumer spending or behavior between consumables and discretionary from your low-income customer? Maybe could you talk to top line trends that you've seen in November maybe relative to same-store sales in the third quarter? And then, Kelly, just with the heightened promotional backdrop, I think you cited, now expected at least through year-end. How best to think about gross margin puts and takes in the fourth quarter, maybe notably markdown?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you, very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3.

So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf, as a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our nondiscretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store.

A matter of fact, Value Valley, that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter, as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet. And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being -- the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope.

We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side. It's just she's being very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween.

So not the candy side, while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday. And while there's a lot of selling left and unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant, and that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that it's probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it.

On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we're capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro-neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that.

The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses. And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations.

So that didn't really change much, and neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages. So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4.

Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Kelly Bania -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Todd and Kelly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the same-day delivery pilot.

What have you learned so far from there? How much of that cost your consumer if they would like the added convenience of that program? And how are you thinking about the margin implications, either passing on the cost of that to the consumer or absorbing those? And just kind of big-picture thoughts about what that could add to the DG kind of growth profile going forward?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Thank you for the question. We're excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2.

And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running. I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating toward it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly.

And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us: one, we want convenience; two, we want an opportunity to always save money; and then third, believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that comes specialized offering.

So we're able to also offer that through this delivery means. The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores.

It could marry very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time.

We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it. And with that comes low cost to both our customer and to Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others.

So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering, we're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network. And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece.

And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top line and bottom line perspective will produce for Dollar General.

Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh -- Analyst

Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go toward FY '25. Any initial puts and takes you can provide? I know your incentive comp could normalize. There could be some hurricane expense benefit.

And including that, any initial thoughts on capex spend just given the significant increase in real estate products anticipated next year? Thank you.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will put pressure on 2025.

The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries. So we're seeing -- and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025.

And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the capex, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation. I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we're expecting right now is a capex that would be similar to this year's capex as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects.

Our next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.

Zhihan Ma -- Analyst

Hi, Todd and Kelly. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the remodeling side of things. Maybe a two-part question.

One, I believe you historically mentioned that the DGTP remodels had an 8% to 11% comp sales lift. That compares to the 6% to 8% you were mentioning today. So has there been any update on that front? And secondly, in terms of the mix of remodels versus new stores going forward, is 2025 a good model for the next couple of years as we think about the medium to longer term?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right.

We had quoted 8% to 11% last year. What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler counts, and so that impacts the top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns.

So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns. So any time you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base, we're excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come.

We're just starting the journey. But the great thing about Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, we'll see in this Project Elevate. So excited about it.

We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025.

Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Seth Sigman -- Analyst

Hey. Good morning, everyone.I wanted to focus on the gross margin. The trend is improving, down less this quarter than prior quarters. As you think about some of the tailwinds such as shrink on paper that should build into the fourth quarter and into next year, can you speak about that? And how you're thinking about gross margin expansion year over year starting in the fourth quarter? And maybe just in general, how you think about the recoverability of the gross margin from here? Thanks so much.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well.

So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but I just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey. And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take a full year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financial statements just because as we take inventories through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there.

The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Scot Ciccarelli -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So historically, when your core customer has been pressured, it's usually resulted in higher traffic but lower ticket as folks buy less but come in more frequently. Today, we're seeing the opposite happen with traffic dropping in the last few quarters. Todd, why do you think that is playing out that way? And would you expect that to change at some point?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. We are squarely focused, as always, on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from LY.

So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously. But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we're never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing for more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch.

The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well. So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's being very, very frugal with that spend and when she spends it.

So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1.

Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lejuez -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks, guys. Curious when you do a remodel, how much of that expected comp lift is traffic versus conversion versus ticket? And then second, on that shrink opportunity on the gross margin line, I'm curious if there's an offset on the SG&A line. And then, Kelly, maybe just high level, how you're thinking about SG&A leverage point for next year.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yes, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, your uptick happens from the offering itself, so more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category, because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds.

So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically. A 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term.

Our final question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.

Chuck Grom -- Analyst

Thanks. Good morning. Good progress. Todd, just how are you thinking about the company's operating margin structure over time? It looks like if we back out the hurricane costs, you're going to exit this year a little bit around 5%.

Can you improve on that over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like the business needs to see some investments both from labor and maybe price before you build from there?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we're pleased where we came out here in Q3.

As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there. We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about '25 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do.

Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respective how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point. I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there.

And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than, obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time.

We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction.

We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about, and delivery could certainly play a big role in that. We've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital, supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today.

And then, of course, our Save to Serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow, which does allow us to invest in the business. And you saw that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth.

So while we're not ready to commit to a time line or, of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it.",,"billion, billion, million, million, million, million, , billion, billion, million, billion, , million, million, million, , , billion, billion, , , , , million, million",,N/A,N/A,"Mexico, U.S., DC, Arkansas, Basics, Colorado, America, South Carolina, Citi, Q4, Arkansas DC"

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution, particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams worked diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas.

In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross, donating gift cards and through our own Employee Assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later. But importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities, and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead.

For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate. Turning to our third quarter performance.

On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter and also grew market share in non consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item.

Customer traffic also increased 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October, and was positive in all three periods of the quarter.

Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior.

We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value, and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted throughout the third quarter, and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year.

With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our Back to Basics work, which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenience proposition, we believe over the longer term, we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points.

This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact.

Now turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months.

While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points.

Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits, offset by the effect of certain rate-impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89.

Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total non consumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well.

We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in-stock levels and drive sales, while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter.

Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding, for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs.

Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1%, and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of 5 fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin.

We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting Back to Basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.

We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations.

Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately three times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance, and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress.

To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We're confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our Back to Basic efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and looked at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain.

We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment.

We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits. And more importantly, our customers are telling us, as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores.

This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate.

We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year, and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF.

Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points and in-full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplified the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates.

In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity and, in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited four more facilities in Q3 for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs.

Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping to stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility.

Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year, we began the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year.

Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items storewide during the holiday season and a low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1.

To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year, as Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year. And we are well on our way to meeting that goal, with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms.

Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50%, compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward.

I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers. And then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March.

First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September, and we're currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores, and the learnings from that initiative and our own customer work have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering with our unique customer base. We believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General, while still providing the value they need.

We are quickly learning and refining our process and, over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience of Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025.

With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within 5 miles or less of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America. As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year.

More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels, while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels and an additional 2,250 Project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations, and we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico.

With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format, which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average.

We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate, and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer-facing areas in the store.

Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels. And in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores, and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores, while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores.

As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio, including: performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20% plus. As we discussed, for our '24 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General-branded stores in the U.S.

As we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities. And nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box, and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products.

And we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year is in the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth.

In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan. And we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025, as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders.

As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Simeon Gutman -- Analyst

Hey, good morning, Todd and Kelly. My question is on the comp algorithm. How does it move now that you're mixing to a higher level of remodels versus store growth? It sounds like you could get almost 1 point of remodel lift, assuming they continue to grow at the rate you expect over the next few years. Where does the comp algorithm land? And then consequently, if it's a little lower than what DG is used to, how much does the cost structure need to evolve? It sounds like you're making progress in a lot of areas.

Some of the supply chain may take a little bit longer, but can you match that cost structure so that you can deliver some of the former earnings growth prior to the last couple of years?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate, that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do.

Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move through the year. So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Lasser -- Analyst

Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Have you seen enough progress with improved execution as well as the mitigation in shrink for you to see line of sight to restoring double-digit EPS growth in 2025 despite having some incentive comp recurring next year?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah, Michael. This is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on Back to Basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on, that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March.

But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work, because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had. Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right? We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can.

So we'll continue to work hard, not only on Back to Basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.

Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. So, Todd, have you seen any notable change in consumer spending or behavior between consumables and discretionary from your low-income customer? Maybe could you talk to top line trends that you've seen in November maybe relative to same-store sales in the third quarter? And then, Kelly, just with the heightened promotional backdrop, I think you cited, now expected at least through year-end. How best to think about gross margin puts and takes in the fourth quarter, maybe notably markdown?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you, very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3.

So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf, as a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our nondiscretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store.

A matter of fact, Value Valley, that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter, as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet. And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being -- the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope.

We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side. It's just she's being very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween.

So not the candy side, while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday. And while there's a lot of selling left and unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant, and that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that it's probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it.

On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we're capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro-neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that.

The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses. And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations.

So that didn't really change much, and neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages. So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Kelly Bania -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Todd and Kelly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the same-day delivery pilot.

What have you learned so far from there? How much of that cost your consumer if they would like the added convenience of that program? And how are you thinking about the margin implications, either passing on the cost of that to the consumer or absorbing those? And just kind of big-picture thoughts about what that could add to the DG kind of growth profile going forward?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Thank you for the question. We're excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2.

And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running. I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating toward it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly.

And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us: one, we want convenience; two, we want an opportunity to always save money; and then third, believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that comes specialized offering.

So we're able to also offer that through this delivery means. The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores.

It could marry very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time.

We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it. And with that comes low cost to both our customer and to Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others.

So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering, we're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network. And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece.

And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top line and bottom line perspective will produce for Dollar General.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh -- Analyst

Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go toward FY '25. Any initial puts and takes you can provide? I know your incentive comp could normalize. There could be some hurricane expense benefit.

And including that, any initial thoughts on capex spend just given the significant increase in real estate products anticipated next year? Thank you.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will put pressure on 2025.

The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries. So we're seeing -- and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025.

And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the capex, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation. I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we're expecting right now is a capex that would be similar to this year's capex as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.

Zhihan Ma -- Analyst

Hi, Todd and Kelly. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the remodeling side of things. Maybe a two-part question.

One, I believe you historically mentioned that the DGTP remodels had an 8% to 11% comp sales lift. That compares to the 6% to 8% you were mentioning today. So has there been any update on that front? And secondly, in terms of the mix of remodels versus new stores going forward, is 2025 a good model for the next couple of years as we think about the medium to longer term?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right.

We had quoted 8% to 11% last year. What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler counts, and so that impacts the top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns.

So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns. So any time you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base, we're excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come.

We're just starting the journey. But the great thing about Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, we'll see in this Project Elevate. So excited about it.

We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Seth Sigman -- Analyst

Hey. Good morning, everyone.I wanted to focus on the gross margin. The trend is improving, down less this quarter than prior quarters. As you think about some of the tailwinds such as shrink on paper that should build into the fourth quarter and into next year, can you speak about that? And how you're thinking about gross margin expansion year over year starting in the fourth quarter? And maybe just in general, how you think about the recoverability of the gross margin from here? Thanks so much.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well.

So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but I just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey. And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take a full year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financial statements just because as we take inventories through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there.

The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Scot Ciccarelli -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So historically, when your core customer has been pressured, it's usually resulted in higher traffic but lower ticket as folks buy less but come in more frequently. Today, we're seeing the opposite happen with traffic dropping in the last few quarters. Todd, why do you think that is playing out that way? And would you expect that to change at some point?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. We are squarely focused, as always, on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from LY.

So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously. But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we're never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing for more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch.

The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well. So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's being very, very frugal with that spend and when she spends it.

So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1.

Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lejuez -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks, guys. Curious when you do a remodel, how much of that expected comp lift is traffic versus conversion versus ticket? And then second, on that shrink opportunity on the gross margin line, I'm curious if there's an offset on the SG&A line. And then, Kelly, maybe just high level, how you're thinking about SG&A leverage point for next year.

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yes, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, your uptick happens from the offering itself, so more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category, because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds.

So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels.

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically. A 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term.

Operator

Our final question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.

Chuck Grom -- Analyst

Thanks. Good morning. Good progress. Todd, just how are you thinking about the company's operating margin structure over time? It looks like if we back out the hurricane costs, you're going to exit this year a little bit around 5%.

Can you improve on that over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like the business needs to see some investments both from labor and maybe price before you build from there?

Todd J. Vasos -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we're pleased where we came out here in Q3.

As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there. We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about '25 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do.

Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respective how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point. I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there.

And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than, obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?

Kelly Dilts -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time.

We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction.

We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about, and delivery could certainly play a big role in that. We've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital, supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today.

And then, of course, our Save to Serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow, which does allow us to invest in the business. And you saw that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth.

So while we're not ready to commit to a time line or, of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it.

TORONTO, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LNG Energy Group Corp. (TSXV: LNGE) (TSXV: LNGE.WT) (OTCQB: LNGNF) (FWB: E26) (the ""Company"" or ""LNG Energy Group"") is pleased to announce a private placement of senior secured convertible debentures in the amount of up to U.S.$15 million (""Private Placement"") in order to drill two development wells, two to three exploration wells and conduct an active workover and stimulation campaign in Colombia.

The Private Placement is undertaken in the context of a broader strategic review process the Company is conducting with the authorization of its Board of Directors, to explore and evaluate a range of potential alternatives for the Company to maximize shareholder value, with the assistance of ECM Capital Advisors, Eight Capital and Haywood Securities Inc. The potential initiatives may include, but are not limited to financings, corporate reorganization, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, divestitures and/or farm-outs, sale, and other forms of business combination.

Pablo Navarro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LNG Energy Group commented, ""It has been a challenging year. Many issues have arisen with which we are dealing. Changes are being made and solutions are being implemented. Bottom line, the asset base is exceptional, and the future is bright. The turnaround is working, and we will work relentlessly to catapult the trajectory of the Company through a series of strategic initiatives that should ultimately contribute to meeting Colombia's need for natural gas.""

Strategic Initiatives

Drilling Campaign

Upon a successful Private Placement, farm-out and/or JV Contribution (as defined herein), the Company will commence a drilling and recompletion campaign in Colombia.

Chemical Stimulations

The Company completed successfully the workover of the BN-1 well consisting of a chemical stimulation that increased the well's production by approximately 3x, offsetting losses caused by the presence of asphaltenes, fines and residues from drilling fluids.

Prior to the stimulation, the well was producing at an average production of approximately 112 Mcf/d with a WHP of 72 psi on a 36/64"" choke. Initial results of the stimulation showed an immediate production increase to 822 Mcf/d with a WHP of 328 psi on a 26/64"" choke. The well is currently producing 350 Mcf/d with 114 psi in WHP and on a 22/64"" choke.

The Company intends to apply this technology to several other wells that also experienced a production decline due to the same root causes.

Costs Optimization

In order to reduce costs, the Company has implemented a corporate reorganization initiative which is expected to result in savings of approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million per annum. The Company continues to review ways to optimize its business and operations, including strategic partnerships with vendors, and rationalization of suppliers, inventory optimization, and adjusting the organizational structure of the Company to the current production context.

Capital Strengthening

The Company is in the process of farming out a part of its participating interest in the VIM-41 Block located onshore Colombia and pursuing a well development financing (the ""JV Contribution"") to raise capital to initiate the drilling of the B5 well located onshore Colombia. Furthermore, the Company intends to review options to optimize cash flow available for drilling vis a vis its financial obligations.

Secured Convertible Debenture Financing

In conjunction with its near-term development plans, the Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with Eight Capital, as lead agent and bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents including Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and ECM Capital Advisors, (together, the ""Agents"") pursuant to which the Company has launched a proposed Private Placement on a ""best efforts"" agency basis in the aggregate principal amount of up to U.S.$15 million (the ""Offering"") senior secured convertible debentures (the ""Convertible Debentures"") to eligible investors.

The terms and any applicable conditions precedent for the Convertible Debentures will be defined within the context of the market and should present a competitive opportunity for investors while unlocking shareholder value.

Upon closing of the Offering, the Company will pay to the Agents a cash commission equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. The Company is entitled to a President's List in the amount of up to U.S.$2 million pursuant to which no fees shall be paid to the Agents.

The net proceeds of the Offering will be primarily used for the Company's next phase of drilling, workover and stimulation activities as well as for general working capital purposes.

The Company expects that insiders and current stakeholders will participate in the Offering and, to date, has received interest from potential investors in the Offering.

The insiders' participation in the Offering constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). Such participation is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the securities anticipated to be acquired by insiders, nor the consideration for the securities paid by such insiders, exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. As the specific participation of each related party that the Company expects will participate in the Offering has not been confirmed as of the date of this news release, additional information required under MI 61-101 will be provided in the Company's material change report with respect to the Offering, including a description of the interest of all related parties in the Offering, and where applicable, a description of the effect on the percentage of the securities of the Company held by related parties participating.

The securities being offered have not, nor will they be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons in the absence of U.S. registration or an applicable exemption from the U.S. registration requirements. This mews release does not constitute an offer for sale of securities in the United States. The Offering is scheduled to close at a date the Company and the Agents deem appropriate and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the execution of an agency agreement and the receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals including that of the TSX Venture Exchange. All securities (and underlying securities) issued in connection with the Offering will be subject to a hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities legislation.

Other Initiatives

The Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and business advisors, are actively considering other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. The Company may initiate a share consolidation or other capital reorganizations. Certain of the foregoing initiatives may require approval from the Company's senior lenders.

The Company's actual decisions, activities, results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements and accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur or, if any of them do, what benefits that the Company will derive from them.

Information and statements relating to reserves are by their nature forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated, and can be profitably produced in the future. The recovery and reserve estimates of the Company's reserves provided herein are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements (see the other advisories contained in this news release).

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include: the Company's ability to complete the Offering on the terms described herein or at all or to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, and/or inability to access sufficient capital on favourable terms; and the delay or failure to receive regulatory or other approvals, including any approvals of the TSXV and the Company's senior lenders, for the Offering; general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; risks related to the Company's ability to complete any of the proposed strategic initiatives described in this news release on the terms described herein or at all; risks related to commodity prices; delay or failure to receive any necessary board, shareholder or regulatory approvals, factors may occur which impede or prevent LNG Energy Group's future business plans; and other factors beyond the control of LNG Energy Group.

Advisory Note Regarding Oil and Gas Information

The reserves information contained in this news release has been prepared in accordance with NI 51-101, but only presents a portion of the disclosure required thereunder. Complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with NI 51-101 in respect of the Company's Colombian assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 is available in the AIF. Complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with NI 51-101 in respect of the Company's Venezuelan assets will be available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca concurrently with or before the filing of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Actual oil and natural gas reserves and future production may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this news release. There is no assurance that forecast prices and costs assumed in the reserves reports referred to in this news release and presented in this news release, will be attained and variances from such forecast prices and costs could be material. The estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed oil and natural gas reserves in this news release does not represent the fair market value of these reserves.

The estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary.

The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. All evaluations and reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provisions for interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been assigned. The tax calculations used in the preparation of the reserves reports referred to in this news release are done at the field level in accordance with standard practice, and do not reflect the actual tax position at the corporate level which may be significantly different.

""Proved"" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. There is a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved reserves.

Light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31.1 degrees API gravity, medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22.3 degrees API gravity and less than or equal to 31.1 degrees API gravity, and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees API gravity and less than or equal to 22.3 degrees API gravity.

The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures within this filing. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of the Company's business and facilitate a meaningful evaluation of its quarterly and fiscal year 2024 diluted income per common share and actual results on a comparable basis with its quarterly and fiscal year 2023 results. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this filing. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. The Company has provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of its ongoing operations. Other companies in the Company's industry may calculate these items differently than it does. Each of these measures is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.

TORONTO, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LNG Energy Group Corp. (TSXV: LNGE) (TSXV: LNGE.WT) (OTCQB: LNGNF) (FWB: E26) (the ""Company"" or ""LNG Energy Group"") is pleased to announce a private placement of senior secured convertible debentures in the amount of up to U.S.$15 million (""Private Placement"") in order to drill two development wells, two to three exploration wells and conduct an active workover and stimulation campaign in Colombia.

The Private Placement is undertaken in the context of a broader strategic review process the Company is conducting with the authorization of its Board of Directors, to explore and evaluate a range of potential alternatives for the Company to maximize shareholder value, with the assistance of ECM Capital Advisors, Eight Capital and Haywood Securities Inc. The potential initiatives may include, but are not limited to financings, corporate reorganization, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, divestitures and/or farm-outs, sale, and other forms of business combination.

Pablo Navarro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LNG Energy Group commented, ""It has been a challenging year. Many issues have arisen with which we are dealing. Changes are being made and solutions are being implemented. Bottom line, the asset base is exceptional, and the future is bright. The turnaround is working, and we will work relentlessly to catapult the trajectory of the Company through a series of strategic initiatives that should ultimately contribute to meeting Colombia's need for natural gas.""

Strategic Initiatives

Drilling Campaign

Upon a successful Private Placement, farm-out and/or JV Contribution (as defined herein), the Company will commence a drilling and recompletion campaign in Colombia.

Chemical Stimulations

Advertisement

The Company completed successfully the workover of the BN-1 well consisting of a chemical stimulation that increased the well's production by approximately 3x, offsetting losses caused by the presence of asphaltenes, fines and residues from drilling fluids.

Prior to the stimulation, the well was producing at an average production of approximately 112 Mcf/d with a WHP of 72 psi on a 36/64"" choke. Initial results of the stimulation showed an immediate production increase to 822 Mcf/d with a WHP of 328 psi on a 26/64"" choke. The well is currently producing 350 Mcf/d with 114 psi in WHP and on a 22/64"" choke.

The Company intends to apply this technology to several other wells that also experienced a production decline due to the same root causes.

Costs Optimization

Advertisement

In order to reduce costs, the Company has implemented a corporate reorganization initiative which is expected to result in savings of approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million per annum. The Company continues to review ways to optimize its business and operations, including strategic partnerships with vendors, and rationalization of suppliers, inventory optimization, and adjusting the organizational structure of the Company to the current production context.

Capital Strengthening

The Company is in the process of farming out a part of its participating interest in the VIM-41 Block located onshore Colombia and pursuing a well development financing (the ""JV Contribution"") to raise capital to initiate the drilling of the B5 well located onshore Colombia. Furthermore, the Company intends to review options to optimize cash flow available for drilling vis a vis its financial obligations.

Secured Convertible Debenture Financing

Advertisement

In conjunction with its near-term development plans, the Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with Eight Capital, as lead agent and bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents including Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and ECM Capital Advisors, (together, the ""Agents"") pursuant to which the Company has launched a proposed Private Placement on a ""best efforts"" agency basis in the aggregate principal amount of up to U.S.$15 million (the ""Offering"") senior secured convertible debentures (the ""Convertible Debentures"") to eligible investors.

The terms and any applicable conditions precedent for the Convertible Debentures will be defined within the context of the market and should present a competitive opportunity for investors while unlocking shareholder value.

Upon closing of the Offering, the Company will pay to the Agents a cash commission equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. The Company is entitled to a President's List in the amount of up to U.S.$2 million pursuant to which no fees shall be paid to the Agents.

The net proceeds of the Offering will be primarily used for the Company's next phase of drilling, workover and stimulation activities as well as for general working capital purposes.

The Company expects that insiders and current stakeholders will participate in the Offering and, to date, has received interest from potential investors in the Offering.

The insiders' participation in the Offering constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). Such participation is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the securities anticipated to be acquired by insiders, nor the consideration for the securities paid by such insiders, exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. As the specific participation of each related party that the Company expects will participate in the Offering has not been confirmed as of the date of this news release, additional information required under MI 61-101 will be provided in the Company's material change report with respect to the Offering, including a description of the interest of all related parties in the Offering, and where applicable, a description of the effect on the percentage of the securities of the Company held by related parties participating.

The securities being offered have not, nor will they be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons in the absence of U.S. registration or an applicable exemption from the U.S. registration requirements. This mews release does not constitute an offer for sale of securities in the United States. The Offering is scheduled to close at a date the Company and the Agents deem appropriate and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the execution of an agency agreement and the receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals including that of the TSX Venture Exchange. All securities (and underlying securities) issued in connection with the Offering will be subject to a hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities legislation.

Other Initiatives

The Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and business advisors, are actively considering other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. The Company may initiate a share consolidation or other capital reorganizations. Certain of the foregoing initiatives may require approval from the Company's senior lenders.

Advisory Note Regarding Oil and Gas Information

The reserves information contained in this news release has been prepared in accordance with NI 51-101, but only presents a portion of the disclosure required thereunder. Complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with NI 51-101 in respect of the Company's Colombian assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 is available in the AIF. Complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with NI 51-101 in respect of the Company's Venezuelan assets will be available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca concurrently with or before the filing of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Actual oil and natural gas reserves and future production may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this news release. There is no assurance that forecast prices and costs assumed in the reserves reports referred to in this news release and presented in this news release, will be attained and variances from such forecast prices and costs could be material. The estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed oil and natural gas reserves in this news release does not represent the fair market value of these reserves.

The estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary.

The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. All evaluations and reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provisions for interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been assigned. The tax calculations used in the preparation of the reserves reports referred to in this news release are done at the field level in accordance with standard practice, and do not reflect the actual tax position at the corporate level which may be significantly different.

inventory optimization,LNG Energy Group Reiterates Value Proposition and Announces Financing and Process to Review Strategic Initiatives,wallstreet:online,https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/18785481-lng-energy-group-reiterates-value-proposition-and-announces-financing-and-process-to-review-strategic-initiatives,"TORONTO, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LNG Energy Group Corp. (TSXV: LNGE) (TSXV: LNGE.WT) (OTCQB: LNGNF) (FWB: E26) (the ""Company"" or ""LNG Energy Group"") is pleased to announce a private placement of senior secured convertible debentures in the amount of up to U.S.$15 million (""Private Placement"") in order to drill two development wells, two to three exploration wells and conduct an active workover and stimulation campaign in Colombia.

The Private Placement is undertaken in the context of a broader strategic review process the Company is conducting with the authorization of its Board of Directors, to explore and evaluate a range of potential alternatives for the Company to maximize shareholder value, with the assistance of ECM Capital Advisors, Eight Capital and Haywood Securities Inc. The potential initiatives may include, but are not limited to financings, corporate reorganization, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, divestitures and/or farm-outs, sale, and other forms of business combination.

Pablo Navarro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LNG Energy Group commented, ""It has been a challenging year. Many issues have arisen with which we are dealing. Changes are being made and solutions are being implemented. Bottom line, the asset base is exceptional, and the future is bright. The turnaround is working, and we will work relentlessly to catapult the trajectory of the Company through a series of strategic initiatives that should ultimately contribute to meeting Colombia's need for natural gas.""

Upon a successful Private Placement, farm-out and/or JV Contribution (as defined herein), the Company will commence a drilling and recompletion campaign in Colombia.

Chemical Stimulations

The Company completed successfully the workover of the BN-1 well consisting of a chemical stimulation that increased the well's production by approximately 3x, offsetting losses caused by the presence of asphaltenes, fines and residues from drilling fluids.

Prior to the stimulation, the well was producing at an average production of approximately 112 Mcf/d with a WHP of 72 psi on a 36/64"" choke. Initial results of the stimulation showed an immediate production increase to 822 Mcf/d with a WHP of 328 psi on a 26/64"" choke. The well is currently producing 350 Mcf/d with 114 psi in WHP and on a 22/64"" choke.

The Company intends to apply this technology to several other wells that also experienced a production decline due to the same root causes.

Costs Optimization

In order to reduce costs, the Company has implemented a corporate reorganization initiative which is expected to result in savings of approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million per annum. The Company continues to review ways to optimize its business and operations, including strategic partnerships with vendors, and rationalization of suppliers, inventory optimization, and adjusting the organizational structure of the Company to the current production context.

Capital Strengthening

The Company is in the process of farming out a part of its participating interest in the VIM-41 Block located onshore Colombia and pursuing a well development financing (the ""JV Contribution"") to raise capital to initiate the drilling of the B5 well located onshore Colombia. Furthermore, the Company intends to review options to optimize cash flow available for drilling vis a vis its financial obligations.

Secured Convertible Debenture Financing

In conjunction with its near-term development plans, the Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with Eight Capital, as lead agent and bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents including Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and ECM Capital Advisors, (together, the ""Agents"") pursuant to which the Company has launched a proposed Private Placement on a ""best efforts"" agency basis in the aggregate principal amount of up to U.S.$15 million (the ""Offering"") senior secured convertible debentures (the ""Convertible Debentures"") to eligible investors.

The terms and any applicable conditions precedent for the Convertible Debentures will be defined within the context of the market and should present a competitive opportunity for investors while unlocking shareholder value.

Upon closing of the Offering, the Company will pay to the Agents a cash commission equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. The Company is entitled to a President's List in the amount of up to U.S.$2 million pursuant to which no fees shall be paid to the Agents.

The net proceeds of the Offering will be primarily used for the Company's next phase of drilling, workover and stimulation activities as well as for general working capital purposes.

The Company expects that insiders and current stakeholders will participate in the Offering and, to date, has received interest from potential investors in the Offering.

The insiders' participation in the Offering constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). Such participation is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the securities anticipated to be acquired by insiders, nor the consideration for the securities paid by such insiders, exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. As the specific participation of each related party that the Company expects will participate in the Offering has not been confirmed as of the date of this news release, additional information required under MI 61-101 will be provided in the Company's material change report with respect to the Offering, including a description of the interest of all related parties in the Offering, and where applicable, a description of the effect on the percentage of the securities of the Company held by related parties participating.

The securities being offered have not, nor will they be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons in the absence of U.S. registration or an applicable exemption from the U.S. registration requirements. This mews release does not constitute an offer for sale of securities in the United States. The Offering is scheduled to close at a date the Company and the Agents deem appropriate and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the execution of an agency agreement and the receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals including that of the TSX Venture Exchange. All securities (and underlying securities) issued in connection with the Offering will be subject to a hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities legislation.

inventory optimization,Unlocking Supply Chain Efficiency: How Technology And Finance Innovators Are Redefining Inventory Management,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulnoble/2024/12/04/unlocking-supply-chain-efficiency-how-technology-and-finance-innovators-are-redefining-inventory-management/,"In today's manufacturing and supply chain environment, a staggering amount of capital is tied up in inventory and procurement, with trillions of dollars being resourced for indirect and direct materials. In fact, across the globe, this significant oversupply is unwittingly locked within the supply chain to manage supply risk, restricting flexibility and hindering effective use of working capital.

What if businesses could not only right-size their inventory levels in warehouses but also optimize them on their balance sheets? This ideal scenario requires a deep understanding of current inventory, accurate forecasting of future needs based on market trends, and a strategic approach to financing procurement or disposing excess stock with maximum financial flexibility.

A new wave of innovators in purpose-built AI technology and finance is making this vision a reality. By combining intelligent inventory optimization with innovative procurement financing, the path is emerging to revolutionize supply chain efficiency without compromise.

Can a combination of technology and refined financial strategies transform the way global enterprises plan for the efficient use of redeploying this capital? In a recent conversation with Sean Hannifin, CEO of Silver Birch Finance, we discussed how, today, working capital finance plays a significant part in supply chain and procurement efficiency, especially as companies get larger and are more distributed. In particular, we discussed how the shift in supply chain technology is ever-changing and how new methods to solve old problems have evolved. In particular, combining today's AI advancements and financing solutions can enable companies to liberate capital, creating leaner and more resilient supply chains, especially in asset-intensive large industrial settings. Here are the key takeaways and strategies from our conversation.

Harnessing AI and Human Expertise for Inventory Precision

One of the most pressing issues supply chain professionals face is the lack of accurate, real-time visibility into inventory levels. Traditional systems often rely on outdated technology and fragmented data sources, leading to redundant ordering, inflated storage costs, and inevitable write-offs due to obsolescence. These inefficiencies tie up capital and hinder a company's ability to respond swiftly to market changes.

One way to address this challenge is to leverage the power of AI and combine it with the deep institutional knowledge of company personnel. Instead of only automating data processing, this approach augments the expertise of employees who understand the nuances of their operations. This synergy between AI and human insight allows businesses to optimize inventory levels more effectively, reduce costs, and retain critical knowledge that might otherwise be lost due to staff turnover or retirement.

By ensuring that the right assets are in the right place at the right time, companies enhance operational efficiency and contribute positively to the broader economy. Efficient inventory management reduces waste and minimizes environmental impact, aligning with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives and promoting sustainable practices across the supply chain.

Resolving the Treasury and Procurement Tug-of-War

However, optimal inventory levels are only half the battle. This is because organizations consistently grapple with an internal tug-of-war between treasury and procurement departments. Treasury aims to keep inventory as lean as possible to maintain a strong balance sheet, emphasizing that tied-up capital incurs costs without equivalent returns. Conversely, procurement gets pushed by internal supply chain stakeholders who advocate for robust stock levels to ensure operational continuity and mitigate supply risks.

According to Sean, innovative financial solutions are emerging to bridge this gap, allowing companies to acquire necessary inventory without the initial capital outlay. This approach satisfies procurement's need for adequate stock while aligning with the treasury's financial constraints.

Sean explains, ""By removing the capital barrier, companies will operate more efficiently and responsively. Procurement teams can secure the necessary inventory, and treasury departments can preserve financial flexibility.""

Additionally, there are options to monetize obsolete or slow-moving assets without compromising price or timing. Companies savor the opportunity to free up the funds they have tied up in excess inventory and then reinvest them into higher-return activities. On the whole, this impacts the bottom line substantially.

A Unified Approach for Greater Impact

Large industrial manufacturing, oil and gas companies, among other industries, are increasingly responding positively to a unified AI technology and supply chain finance approach. One major manufacturing company faced excess inventory and high holding costs due to its limited visibility throughout multiple facilities. They transformed their procurement process by adopting advanced technology for accurate inventory insights and leveraging innovative financing.

Suppliers were paid promptly under existing terms without the need for complex supply chain finance programs or additional contracts. This strengthened supplier relationships and enhanced supplier stability, making the client a preferred partner. The company also monetized obsolete inventory, freeing up warehouse space and capital for reinvestment. By synchronizing asset acquisition with actual usage needs, they reduced unnecessary expenditures and optimized cash flow without compromising operational effectiveness.

Driving ESG Goals and Economic Empowerment

The collaboration between technology and finance innovators doesn't just benefit individual companies; it has broader implications for ESG goals and economic empowerment. Efficient inventory management and optimized procurement contribute to sustainability by reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. Financial solutions that support suppliers of all sizes promote economic inclusivity and strengthen the overall supply chain ecosystem.

Conclusion

In an era where supply chain complexities are heightened by global uncertainties in the face of potential tariffs and a trade war, the fusion of advanced technology and innovative finance offers a pathway to unprecedented efficiency and resilience. By right-sizing inventory in warehouses and on balance sheets, companies can unlock significant value, reduce risks, and position themselves for sustainable growth.

The collaborative efforts of AI technology and strategic finance have emerged to reflect how combining strengths leads to more significant synergies and client value. As more businesses adopt these integrated solutions, the benefits will extend beyond individual organizations, contributing to a more agile, sustainable, and inclusive global supply chain.

The future of resilient supply chain management lies in partnerships, where legacy technologies, intelligent purpose-built plug-ins, and finance work hand in hand to solve age-old challenges. It's a promising development that addresses immediate operational needs and supports broader economic empowerment and ESG objectives -- a win-win for all stakeholders involved.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

inventory optimization,6 Supply Chain Trends for 2025 - Business Review,Business Review,https://business-review.eu/business/transport-and-logistics/6-supply-chain-trends-for-2025-276232,"Recently, global supply chains have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Companies are finding it hard to ensure continuous product and service deliveries due to pandemic outbreaks, geopolitical conflicts, extreme climate incidents and volatile markets.

With 2025 coming closer, it is important for businesses to keep pace with the upcoming changes in supply chain trends. This will help them stay competitive and strong. This article details key shifts expected to impact supply chains over the next year as well as recommendations on how organizations may effectively equip themselves and adapt their strategies accordingly.

The pandemic exposed the risks associated with relying on one supplier or region, prompting companies to adopt multi-sourcing strategies by seeking suppliers from multiple geographical regions in order to minimize supply disruption risks. This is particularly true in the electronic component industry, where new advancements like AI integration into enterprise computing solutions are reshaping the landscape, further underscoring the need for partnering with reliable independent distributors in order to keep a strong position against competitors and maximize supply chain resilience.

The concepts of nearshoring and reshoring are becoming more popular recently. Companies are moving their production closer to where they are based. This allows them to cut down on the time it takes for delivery and the cost of transporting goods. This helps create a more robust supply chain that can adapt more quickly in response to unexpected disruptions.

Companies are increasing their investments in comprehensive risk management strategies to handle unexpected events. They use advanced analysis and scenario planning tools to predict possible disruptions, ranging from natural catastrophes to political instability. Moreover, backup plans like keeping safety stock levels or creating different supply routes have been established in order to keep operations running during crisis periods.

AI and machine learning technologies are revolutionizing supply chain management by offering more accurate demand forecasting and inventory optimization. AI-powered tools can analyze large datasets in real time to help companies anticipate changes in demand, maintain stock balance, and minimize waste.

IoT devices are revolutionizing how companies monitor their supply chains by providing real-time information on inventory levels, transportation statuses and environmental conditions. Companies using IoT sensors for shipment monitoring can ensure prompt deliveries while simultaneously reducing risks of misplaced or damaged goods, providing clearer decision-making insights and fast actions when problems occur.

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing supply chain transparency. By offering an immutable ledger that records every transaction in real time, stakeholders can verify the origin and journey of products with incredible precision. Such improved clarity not only improves trust among consumers and businesses but also helps identify inefficiencies within supply chains and curb fraudsters.

As the demand for eco-friendly products increases among consumers, businesses are focusing more on sustainable sourcing methods. They choose suppliers who follow ethical and green practices, utilize recycled materials, and make efforts to reduce resource waste.

Many companies, especially those in logistics and transportation, have started making it their main focus to decrease carbon emissions. Businesses are beginning to use electric vehicles, make delivery routes more efficient, and work together with logistics partners who also value sustainability. Not only do these actions lessen the damage they cause to the environment but they also attract customers who prefer brands showing social responsibility.

Circular economies are quickly growing in popularity as businesses progressively focus on recycling and reusing materials to minimize waste while simultaneously cutting expenses by prolonging product lifespans.

Statistics reveal that only 6% of companies achieve complete supply chain visibility, thus making achieving end-to-end visibility in 2025 a key priority. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and transportation management systems bring visibility across every stage of supply chains allowing companies to make informed decisions, monitor performance more closely, and quickly identify areas for improvement.

Predictive analytics uses past and current data to predict future demand and trends within the supply chain. Big data helps businesses recognize patterns, anticipate disruptions and alter plans accordingly, thus decreasing stockout risks or overstocking for greater overall efficiency.

Quick progress in supply chains and technology has led to a severe lack of people with digital and analytical abilities. To address this, companies are putting resources towards professional growth and retraining programs. The aim is to give their workers these important skills so they can easily adjust to new technologies and processes that focus on data. This not only increases work efficiency but also helps retain top talent in a competitive job market.

As labor shortages and turnover rates in logistics increase, enterprises are prioritizing employee welfare through retention strategies like flexible work hours, remote working options and better compensation packages. Businesses that place high value on employee satisfaction could experience enhanced productivity as well as reduced turnover rates.

Shifts in international trade frameworks, such as new tariffs, trade agreements or export restrictions, have the ability to dramatically affect supply chains. Therefore, companies must remain up-to-date with these developments to effectively adapt their procurement and distribution tactics and mitigate any potential threats from fluctuating trade conditions. Broadening supplier networks or exploring untapped markets are two effective strategies businesses can employ in navigating changing trade environments.

Different sectors are seeing new rules related to sustainability, work policies and data privacy which affect how businesses run. Companies have to follow these laws so they do not face punishments or risk damaging their public image. Keeping up with strategies for managing compliance and regularly checking supply chain processes is crucial in order to stay updated on changes in regulations and remain compliant.

As we approach 2025, companies must adjust to an ever-evolving supply chain terrain consisting of new technologies, sustainability initiatives and fluctuating consumer needs. By understanding and taking advantage of emerging supply chain patterns, businesses can strengthen durability while simultaneously increasing productivity levels to remain competitive in an ever-evolving supply chain landscape.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended October 27, 2024 increased $1 million, or 0.1%, to $751 million compared with $750 million for the nine months ended October 29, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., the most comparable GAAP financial metric, as applicable, see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended October 27, 2024 was $260 million compared with $373 million for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The $113 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by more typical investment in working capital in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared with a larger inventory reduction in the three months ended October 29, 2023 due to inventory optimization subsequent to supply chain improvements.

Net debt, calculated as gross consolidated debt net of cash and cash equivalents, as of October 27, 2024 was $2,420 million. Net Debt Leverage (defined as the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months) was 2.7x compared with 1.5x as of October 29, 2023. Net debt leverage for the twelve months ended October 27, 2024 and the twelve months ended October 29, 2023 does not give pro forma effect to acquisitions.

As of October 27, 2024, we had $235 million outstanding borrowings on our senior asset-based revolving credit facility (""Senior ABL Credit Facility""), which provides for borrowings of up to $1,250 million, subject to borrowing base availability. As of October 27, 2024, after giving effect to approximately $15 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow approximately $1,000 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability.

Fiscal 2024 Outlook

""We are raising our full year outlook based on results to-date, recent acquisitions, and our expectation that both prices and our end markets will remain stable through the end of the year,"" LeClair said. ""The non-discretionary repair and replacement portion of our business remains resilient, and we are pleased with our level of execution to expand gross margins sequentially from the second quarter. We expect full year net sales to range from $7,350 to $7,450 million and we expect Adjusted EBITDA to range from $915 to $935 million. Our teams continue to lead and innovate, and we are optimistic that our scale, entrepreneurial culture and strong balance sheet position us to deliver meaningful value creation over the long-term.""

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), we present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not considered measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance or liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity.

We define EBITDA as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, adjusted for non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes and interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including but not limited to (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the initial public offering and subsequent offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We define Operating Cash Flow Conversion as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the period presented. We define Net Debt Leverage as total consolidated debt (gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs), net of cash and cash equivalents, divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months.

We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage to assess the operating results and effectiveness and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated Company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies and may not be calculated in the same manner. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage are not alternative measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. and other performance measures such as gross profit or net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.

No reconciliation of the estimated range for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin or Operating Cash Flow Conversion for fiscal 2024 is included herein because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. or cash provided by or used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty to predict certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be misleading to investors. In particular, the effects of acquisition expenses cannot be reasonably predicted in light of the inherent difficulty in quantifying such items on a forward-looking basis. We expect the variability of these excluded items may have an unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented:

""We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, including record quarterly sales and Adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating that Core & Main can grow in any environment,"" said Steve LeClair, chair and CEO of Core & Main.

""Our ongoing focus on driving organic market share gains, combined with our disciplined approach to M&A, enabled us to achieve nearly 12% sales growth in the third quarter.

""Our strategic approach to capital allocation further demonstrates our commitment to growth and creating value for shareholders. We completed five acquisitions during and after the quarter to expand our presence in key geographies, gain access to new product lines and add key talent. We also deployed $100 million to repurchase and retire 2.46 million shares, reinforcing our confidence in our outlook and ability to deploy capital to generate strong returns.

""Overall, our teams are executing our strategy, outperforming the market with organic volume growth, and advancing our initiatives to support growth and margin expansion in 2025 and beyond. As a leader in the industry, Core & Main is committed to being a valuable partner in the supply chain, utilizing our scale and capabilities to support our customers and their complex project needs. Looking ahead, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on a range of strategic growth opportunities while delivering value to our customers and shareholders,"" LeClair concluded.

Three Months Ended October 27, 2024

Net sales for the three months ended October 27, 2024 increased $211 million, or 11.5%, to $2,038 million compared with $1,827 million for the three months ended October 29, 2023. Net sales increased primarily due to acquisitions and comparably higher end-market volumes partially offset by slightly lower selling prices. Net sales increased for pipes, valves & fittings due to acquisitions and comparably higher end-market volumes partially offset by slightly lower selling prices. Net sales increased for storm drainage products due to acquisitions and our ability to drive the adoption of advanced storm water management systems. Net sales for fire protection products declined due to lower selling prices and comparably lower end-market volumes. Net sales of meter products benefited from our ability to drive the adoption of smart meter technology through municipalities, increased product availability and acquisitions.

Gross profit for the three months ended October 27, 2024 increased $49 million, or 9.9%, to $543 million compared with $494 million for the three months ended October 29, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 27, 2024 was 26.6% compared with 27.0% for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The overall decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to larger prior year benefits from strategic inventory investments during an inflationary period partially offset by favorable impacts from the execution of our gross margin initiatives and accretive acquisitions.

Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses for the three months ended October 27, 2024 increased $34 million, or 14.2%, to $274 million compared with $240 million during the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase was generally attributable to acquisitions. Other SG&A costs increased slightly due to investments in growth and higher inflation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.4% for the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared with 13.1% for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions, investments in growth and inflationary cost impacts.

Operating income for the three months ended October 27, 2024 increased $6 million, or 2.8%, to $223 million compared with $217 million during the three months ended October 29, 2023.

Net income for the three months ended October 27, 2024 decreased $18 million, or 11.4%, to $140 million compared with $158 million for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense and income tax expense partially offset by an increase in operating income.

The Class A common stock basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended October 27, 2024 both increased 6.2% to $0.69 compared with $0.65 for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase in basic earnings per share was attributable to an increase in net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. partially offset by higher Class A share counts from exchanges of limited partner interests of Core & Main Holdings, LP (""Partnership Interests""). Diluted earnings per share increased due to lower share counts following the share repurchase transactions executed throughout fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 partially offset by a decline in net income.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended October 27, 2024 increased $17 million, or 6.5%, to $277 million compared with $260 million for the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.

The overall decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to larger prior year benefits from strategic inventory investments during an inflationary period partially offset by favorable impacts from the execution of our gross margin initiatives and accretive acquisitions.

SG&A expenses for the nine months ended October 27, 2024 increased $98 million, or 14.0%, to $799 million compared with $701 million during the nine months ended October 29, 2023.

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), we present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not considered measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance or liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity.

We define EBITDA as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, adjusted for non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes and interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including but not limited to (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the initial public offering and subsequent offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We define Operating Cash Flow Conversion as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the period presented. We define Net Debt Leverage as total consolidated debt (gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs), net of cash and cash equivalents, divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months.

We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage to assess the operating results and effectiveness and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated Company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies and may not be calculated in the same manner. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow Conversion and Net Debt Leverage are not alternative measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. and other performance measures such as gross profit or net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.

No reconciliation of the estimated range for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin or Operating Cash Flow Conversion for fiscal 2024 is included herein because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. or cash provided by or used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty to predict certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be misleading to investors. In particular, the effects of acquisition expenses cannot be reasonably predicted in light of the inherent difficulty in quantifying such items on a forward-looking basis. We expect the variability of these excluded items may have an unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented:

                     GE Aerospace Created AI Wingmate in Six Weeks. Can You Say 'Next Level'?",geaerospace.com,https://www.geaerospace.com/news/articles/ge-aerospace-created-ai-wingmate-six-weeks-can-you-say-next-level,"In 2022, not long after ChatGPT was first made available to the general public, GE Aerospace leadership noticed many employees using the powerful generative artificial intelligence platform in their work. While this was unsurprising for the company's tech-forward culture, it also raised concerns that sensitive or proprietary information might find its way into the data oceans such large language models (LLMs) train on. The leadership team saw two options. ""One, we could simply block access to ChatGPT on work laptops,"" recalls Dinakar Deshmukh, vice president of data science. ""Or two, we could provide a safe, secure, internal alternative to ChatGPT that allowed them to continue using the tools we know they want and could benefit them and the company.""

Clearly, option two was more attractive. The problem was that someone would have to build this GE Aerospace-only version of generative AI, make it as powerful, responsive, and resourceful as the consumer version, and do it quickly enough not to frustrate employees who had incorporated ChatGPT into their work life. This past spring, a small team partnered with Microsoft to attempt this very thing.

""We put together a road map for how we were going to build it, as well as how we'd release it when it was ready,"" says Deshmukh. Working with Microsoft's accelerator program for LLM chat apps, they helped Microsoft adapt its codebase to meet GE Aerospace's specific needs, making the company's deep wellspring of knowledge instantly accessible to all employees through targeted searches in its chat function.

Microsoft estimated that it would take two weeks to set up the application's back-end service. When he heard this, Deshmukh chose a goal of four to six weeks for his GE Aerospace team to execute the rest. ""Sometimes ignorance is bliss,"" he says.

The project to build this new internal platform -- which they named AI Wingmate -- drew on a vast array of cross-functional talent within the company. ""A product manager, a data scientist, a user experience expert, cloud and back-end specialists, cyber, legal, middleware -- people from all different parts of the organization were involved,"" Deshmukh continues, citing active participants in Bengaluru, Cincinnati, Detroit, Florida, New York, and Seattle. ""We'd have a morning conversation at nine o'clock and an evening one at five, because a team in India was working on the same issues. We deployed the 'follow the sun model' very effectively for this project. The first four weeks were extremely intense. Everybody was working well beyond their normal hours, because they all realized that giving something like this to GE Aerospace employees, at this scale, would be game-changing.""

Why game-changing? ""Until now, there was no application available to our entire employee base,"" he explains. ""And by its nature, this will shift the culture within GE Aerospace, giving everyone the ability to interact with the AI systems that can take them to the next level."" For more than a decade, the company had been marshaling AI technology to enhance engine monitoring, predictive maintenance, fuel optimization, inventory optimization, and a host of other specialized functions, as well as partnering with other hyperscaler companies for specific business applications. But this would transform the work life of every employee at GE Aerospace. ""Everyone on the team realized they could be a catalyst for this,"" says Deshmukh.

They still needed to overcome a range of challenges to execute the project at scale. ""For one thing, we had to make sure that we developed this in a very compliant way, from both a cyber and legal standpoint,"" Deshmukh says. Since AI Wingmate operates within the guardrails of GE Aerospace's virtual private cloud (VPC) network, every pipeline in and out of that VPC is encrypted. ""We had to get approvals and follow that process in very little time without taking shortcuts.""

They also had to develop a unique GE Aerospace identity for the application. ""Once we had the initial layouts, our branding team played a key role in helping us with finalizing the look and feel of the platform and making it real,"" he continues. ""The branding and communications team was instrumental in helping us come up with the name for the internal application, AI Wingmate.""

Once Microsoft built the back end, the GE Aerospace team created the system's interface. ""At first we had trouble making it work smoothly, because some responses from the GPT-4 model were unexpected,"" says Deshmukh.

While fixing these issues, the team found a problem with the application's responsiveness. ""We saw that sharing large public graphic processing units (GPUs) with users worldwide was slowing the app down,"" he says. To address this issue, Microsoft agreed to set aside some GPU capacity just for AI Wingmate. ""That action on the part of Microsoft really helped resolve the problem, and from there we did not look back.""

From that point, AI Wingmate underwent a rapid, internally crowdsourced evolution, much like what machine learning itself does in the wild. ""At four weeks, we released it to the first batch of 2,000 users and started getting feedback on what was working and what wasn't working so well,"" Deshmukh says. ""We learned a ton and were able to make some important final adjustments to ready the tool for launch to all 52,000 GE Aerospace employees.""

Rather than the free version of ChatGPT most employees were familiar with, the team decided to base AI Wingmate on the higher-end technology in GPT-4. ""It's a much higher order of cost, but we decided to give our employees the best possible experience,"" says Deshmukh. They also ran and recorded training sessions to determine how best to interact with AI Wingmate, and made these videos available as guides for effective usage.

One important aspect of generative AI is that ""no matter what model you're using, the responses you get are dependent on two important factors,"" Deshmukh says. ""One: how you ask the question. And two: how you validate the answers you get back. As people get more skilled at prompts, they're able to use AI Wingmate to help them explain increasingly complex things in an easy-to-understand way."" A good teacher as well as communicator, AI Wingmate also helped some employees learn programming fundamentals. ""I know many engineers are using it to learn Python,"" says Deshmukh.

Failing, Learning, Adjusting, Then Moving Forward with FLIGHT DECK and More

Deshmukh reports that the system has topped more than 1 million prompts from 14,000 active users within the past 150-plus days. For the past five months, AI Wingmate has been available to all employees. The next phase will integrate FLIGHT DECK, GE Aerospace's proprietary lean operating model, into the platform, providing a dedicated learning module to help employees engage with this powerful tool.

With the AI Wingmate project, GE Aerospace stands out from industry peers as an early adopter. ""GE Aerospace is an industrial company,"" says Deshmukh. ""We are not a digital company. But at the same time, we want to make sure our workforce has a best-in-class experience, and we can provide them with all the right tools and resources for them to be most effective.""

The rapid rollout reflects digital tech's ever-evolving nature through learning and reiterations, as well as the sense of community within GE Aerospace. ""Going to 52,000 employees with an AI application like this in six weeks might sound a bit crazy to some companies,"" Deshmukh says. ""But on this project, we were willing to fail, learn, and adjust ourselves rather than wait for eight months or a year to find the absolutely perfect solution for everyone.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Adjusting, Bengaluru, Cincinnati, Seattle, Florida, New York, Detroit"

inventory optimization,American Eagle Set to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,NASDAQ Stock Market,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-eagle-set-report-q3-earnings-whats-offing,"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO is expected to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Dec. 4. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.30 billion, which indicates a rise of 0.3% from the year-ago figure.

The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents per share, indicating a 6.1% drop from the year-ago quarter's number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved down a penny in the past 30 days.

The company's earnings beat the consensus estimate by 2.6% in the last reported quarter. It delivered an earnings surprise of 12% in the trailing four quarters, on average.

American Eagle's fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from continued brand strength and solid demand, driven by compelling products and exciting new marketing campaigns. Favorable demand for its leading brands and expansion efforts into new markets have been driving its top-line performance. Innovation efforts, solid omnichannel capabilities and inventory-optimization efforts are likely to have boosted the company's performance.

In addition, AEO's cost-reduction efforts, strength in Aerie and solid online show remain key drivers. The company has been gaining from the robust Aerie brand, driven by sturdy demand in its core apparel, activewear extension, strength in the OFFLINE brand and renewed momentum in intimates. Its flagship brand has also doing well for a while. Tops, skirts, dresses and shorts have been performing well. We expect sales rise of 1% for American Eagle and 0.7% for Aerie in the fiscal third quarter.

American Eagle is on track with its Powering Profitable Growth plan and remains committed to amplifying brands, optimizing operations and executing the financial discipline. AEO's profit improvement initiatives have been paying off. These strengths are likely to have bolstered the company's performance.

Management, on its lastearnings callfor the fiscal third quarter, anticipates operating income to be in the range of $120-$125 million compared with our estimate of $122.9 million. American Eagle expects comparable sales to grow in the band of 3-4%, with total revenues estimated to remain flat to rise slightly due to the impact of the retail calendar. SG&A is likely to leverage, with dollars down slightly, owing to the efficiencies in key focus areas. We expect comparable sales to increase 3.2% and revenues to rise 0.5% for the same quarter.

However, AEO is exposed to a tough operating landscape, including inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds. The evolving consumer spending patterns have been concerning as well. Further, increased corporate compensation, incentives and other corporate expenses are deterrents. These expenses are likely to have weighed on the company's profitability.

What the Zacks Model Unveils for AEO

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Eagle this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that's not the case here.

Northern is continuing to work towards its goal of becoming a vertically integrated, mine-to-market supplier to traditional downstream customers and to the emerging ‎‎market for battery anode material as well as for next generation All Solid State battery chemistries. The main catalysts of the Company's strategy include growing graphite production from our cornerstone LDI mine, restarting the Okanjande mine in Namibia, developing the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario, developing downstream capacity to produce advanced BAM for use in lithium-ion batteries and EVs in North America and Europe, and upgrading graphite mine concentrate into value added industrial products.

Mining Operations

As the only producer of natural flake graphite in North America, Northern has a first mover, competitive advantage in supplying Western markets with graphite for the EV revolution. The Company's projects in Canada and Namibia are all battery grade, and can be scaled in a relatively quick, low-cost manner by leveraging existing permitting and infrastructure at both LDI and at its Okanjande mine in Namibia and the advanced state of the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario.

Lac des Iles Mine - Quebec

Northern is boosting output from the LDI mine and processing plant to meet growing demand from industrial customers and coming demand from North American battery makers. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volume and revenue from LDI have increased significantly, and continuously, up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023. Following the announcement of a temporary shutdown for maintenance during November and December 2024, the Company is continuing to serve its customers from existing inventory and from third parties to avoid disruptions as demand remains significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The LDI mill is forecast to reopen on or around January 6, 2025.

After a new resource estimate in January 2024 showed potential to extend the life of LDI by approximately eight years (to be confirmed and quantified through an updated mineral reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan), the Company has begun permitting to open a new pit in 2025. Northern has also launched an additional drilling program with the objectives of further expanding resources, identifying resources with a lower strip ratio and spending $1.85 million to meet the Company's obligations under its 2023 flow through share financing. According to the mineral resource estimate, prepared in the first quarter by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. and based on the results of a 2023 drilling campaign, Indicated Mineral Resources now total approximately 3.29 million tonnes (""Mt"") at an average grade of 6.4% graphitic carbon (""Cg""), containing approximately 213,000 tonnes of Cg. Inferred Mineral Resources total approximately 1.43 Mt at an average grade of 7.4% Cg, containing approximately 106,000 tonnes of Cg. Existing stockpiles at the mine site are not included in the updated mineral resource estimate. The updated mineral resource estimate assumes an open pit mining scenario and a long-term average flake graphite concentrate market price of US$1,550 per tonne. Mineral resources are constrained within an optimized pit shell at a cut-off grade of 2.3% Cg. A technical report in respect of the mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on March 1, 2024.

Okanjande Project - Namibia

The Company continues to evaluate options to fund the Okanjande project through the use of a royalty/stream/debt structure and equity contributed by a strategic partner without having to go to the market at current share prices. During the third quarter of 2023, Northern placed Okanjande on care and maintenance except for engineering and activities relating to moving the plant from its site at Okorusu to Okanjande. The timing of the restart is subject to the availability of project financing. A technical report in respect of a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") for the Okanjande project prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on August 28, 2023. The PEA indicated that the economics are attractive under a plan to move the processing plant from Okorusu to the mine site with higher capital costs but lower operating costs. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, sustainability is improved, and the expansion potential of the project is substantially enhanced.

Advancing Mine-to-Market Strategy -Partnering for Progress

Northern is advancing its mine-to-market-to-battery strategy and in October reached a milestone partnership agreement with Rain Carbon Inc. , a leading supplier of carbon precursor and carbon products, to develop advanced natural graphite Battery Anode Material that improves the performance and reduces the costs and carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Under the terms of the JDA, Northern and RAIN will jointly develop and commercialize natural graphite BAM products that are engineered to address critical market demands for extended cycle life, enhanced charging speed and reduced electrode swelling in lithium-ion battery cells. The JDA will answer a market need for higher-quality natural graphite anode material that is also lower cost and more environmentally friendly than synthetic graphite, underscoring Northern's commitment to delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that align with the EV industry's evolving requirements and global decarbonization goals.

The JDA with RAIN complements Northern's broader strategy to become a fully integrated mine-to-battery producer and processor of graphite for lithium-ion batteries, employing advanced milling and shaping, purification and coating technologies to produce BAM at scale from a planned 200,000 tpy facility at the deepwater port of Baie-Comeau, Quebec. The plant is planned to be built in modules to de-risk investment and tailor construction to demand growth in EV markets, and is subject to financing, regulatory approvals and certain other conditions. The facility is eligible for assistance under programs offered by the province of Québec, the Canadian and U.S. governments, as well as other assistance by the Manicouagan region and potential Plan Nord incentives. Northern has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations with technology and OEM partners in both the U.S. and Europe who want to collaborate with a quality supplier of graphite that has current production, immediately available inventory and the capacity to support future growth. Discussions center on volume requirements and the timing thereof and plans for downstream conversion facilities in both North America and Europe. Numerous, active discussions are ongoing with respect to strategic partnerships and offtake agreements and there continue to be many positive developments in the EV/battery/critical minerals space. In addition, the Company is working closely with federal and provincial government organizations to gain support to accelerate the development of the battery anode supply chain, with a particular focus on Ontario and Québec.

Northern's battery materials division (""NGCBM""), launched in February 2024 to drive the Company's mine-to-battery strategy, is also advancing in its efforts to commercialize Porocarb®, its patented, high-performance microporous hard carbon material used to boost performance in next generation battery chemistries for electric vehicles, including both lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. The product is currently being evaluated with very positive results by top tier battery manufacturers from South Korea, China and several Western countries. Porocarb® has the potential to provide significant revenue to the Company sooner than natural graphite lithium-ion BAM products.

Market Commentary

Global graphite markets face rising supply pressures amid geopolitical tensions with China, driving consumers to establish secure future supply chains in the West that are less reliant on the world's largest producer and processor of this leading component in lithium-ion batteries. Northern has already seen sustained demand growth and near-record sales to industrial customers since the second half of last year, and those trends are seen continuing into 2025. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate, 58% higher than last year, with an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne, 14% lower than the previous year's period amid inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also expected to be favorable as a result of efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, including further inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Management has been aggressively pursuing new markets/customer opportunities in North America and Europe in order to balance liquidity with the amount of working capital tied up in inventories, and to create a market for future expected Namibian production. While we are still awaiting greater clarity on U.S. trade policy under a second Trump presidency, as a member of the North American Graphite Alliance, which represents North American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, Northern continues to engage with the White House, OEMs and other producers to find ways to protect and stimulate the graphite industry. To date, Canada, the United States and Europe have all announced tariffs on EV imports to support their automotive industries and better compete with China.

Balance Sheet Commentary

Northern implemented strict cost control measures during the second and third quarters of 2024 to better manage its cash position, bolster its balance sheet and optimize its working capital, including sales of inventory, optimization of accounts receivable and operating the LDI mill on a seven-days-a-week schedule. The level of production at LDI since its acquisition has not been sufficient to sustain the Company on a cash flow basis, and operational deficits have been financed by external financings and the sale of inventories. In order to make the Company self-sustaining and meet growing demand stimulated by EV sales, Chinese export controls and US tariffs on Chinese graphite, Northern is working to ramp up output at LDI to nameplate capacity of 25,000 tpy. While the expansion is expected to increase operating income, it also requires an additional investment in a new pit and working capital that is straining resources, and discussions continue around amending the Company's existing loan and royalty agreements, including in particular the senior debt interest which was capitalized in 2023.

The Company continues to report as current liabilities its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as a result of the Company not meeting the following covenants related to these instruments:

The lender and royalty holder have waived all defaults as of September 30, 2024 and as of November, 27 2024. The Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to amending the terms of its senior secured loan and royalty financing to better align with project timelines that have shifted with markets that are evolving at a slower pace than forecast. While these discussions are ongoing, the lender and royalty holder is supportive of Northern's growth plans and is keen to work with the Company to find ways to capitalize on the new resource and extended mine life potential at LDI and allow the Company to benefit from a strong industrial market for graphite in North America as well as coming demand from EV markets.

Going forward, the Company intends to continue to reduce inventories to generate liquidity and maintain strict overhead cost controls that were implemented during the last two quarters of 2024, as well as consider a number of other strategies until support for the only operating graphite mine in North America materializes or markets improve. The Company also continues to seek support from federal, provincial and US government agencies as well as EV and battery manufacturers.

Corporate Update

On October 11, 2024, the Company announced the resignation of Guillaume Jacq as Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), effective November 30, 2024, to pursue other career opportunities. Niall Moore, Northern's Group Controller and a Chartered Professional Accountant with over 35 years of experience, will assume the responsibilities of the CFO role on an interim basis.

In closing, Mr. Jacquemin commented:

""While the current situation is challenging, the long term outlook for our strategy to sell to the EV battery space remains strong and we continue to implement measures to enable the Company to weather the prevailing environment and carry us through until graphite markets recover. We are putting the pieces in place to be ready when markets improve to supply North American battery makers with graphite from our mines, tailored into battery anode material that fits their needs and is sourced close to their end markets.""

Operational Highlights: Driving Our Growth Catalysts

To meet increasing customer demand, the Company saw continued strong production volume from the plant at its Lac des Iles (""LDI"") mine for a third consecutive quarter and achieved record sales from June 30 through September 30 after moving to a four shifts, seven-days-a-week schedule. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volumes and revenues from LDI are up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023;

During the fourth quarter, management made the decision to put the LDI plant under a two-month maintenance shutdown to complete repairs and maintenance and plans to increase throughput to nameplate capacity when it reopens in January. This will enable the Company to meet growing demand for natural graphite sourced outside of China;

After a successful 2023 drilling campaign and a new resource estimate showed potential to significantly extend the life of LDI, the Company started permitting in the fourth quarter to open a new pit in the new year. A second drilling program has also been launched with the goal of further increasing production through successful exploration;

In June, the Company received support from Québec's Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et des Forêts (""MRNF"") in the form of a grant for a total of $0.4 million to pay 50 percent of eligible expenses for geo-metallurgical and geo-environmental drilling to be carried out this year on the LDI mining lease;

In preparation to supply coming demand from North American battery markets, Northern signed a Joint Development Agreement (""JDA"") with Rain Carbon Inc. (""Rain"") to develop and commercialize advanced, natural graphite battery anode material (""BAM"") products used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (""EVs"");

The Company continued development of its battery materials portfolio and advanced discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturers (""OEMs"") and battery makers, and Northern's patented Porocarb® product is currently being evaluated by leading global battery manufacturers with very positive results.

Financial Highlights: Focus on Cash Management

Revenue of $6.7 million based on 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate sold at an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne (US$1,205 per tonne). The average realized price in the third quarter was 17% below the second quarter of 2024, mainly due to commercial efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, which included inventory spot sales for cash management purposes, which have negatively impacted average sales prices and margins;

Cash costs of $1,413 (US$1,035) per tonne of graphite concentrate sold represented a 9% improvement compared to second quarter costs of $1,560 per tonne (US$1,035). Production costs have been negatively impacted by inefficiencies and unexpected breakdowns which have impacted the ability of the LDI plant to ramp up operations;

Loss from mine operations was $0.6 million, compared to income from mine operations of $0.1 million during the second quarter;

General and administrative expenses during the third quarter were in line with the second quarter of 2024, which were 13% lower than the first quarter of 2024 as a result of the implementation of strict overhead cost control measures;

The LDI plant was in full production during the third quarter with production volumes of 3,630 tonnes. Mining operations were stopped on July 15, 2024 and restarted on September 3, 2024 to preserve cash while the plant continued to operate;

Finance costs were $2.9 million, almost all of which were non-cash items;

An impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded due to the identification of variances following a physical count of finished goods inventories;

A net loss of $4.8 million ($0.04 per share) which included significant non-cash charges relating to depletion and depreciation, share-based compensation, capitalized finance expenses, impairment expenses and drawdown of inventories. Cash used in operating activities was $nil and slightly deteriorated compared to the second quarter when cash provided by operating activities of $0.1 million was reported, mostly as an effect of lower average sales prices;

As of September 30, 2024, and in line with June 30, 2024, the Company continued to report its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as current liabilities as a result of the lack of performance by the Company on the following covenants related to these instruments:

Senior secured loan - The Company had not met some of the covenants relating to the amended and restated credit agreement dated November 29, 2023, including:

The payment of accrued interest of $1.6 million (US$1.2 million) on the semi-annual cash interest payment date as of September 30, 2024;

Maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, positive working capital, and

Maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, a minimum cash balance of $750,000.

Royalty financing - The Company had not met certain covenants related to the amended and restated royalty agreement dated November 29, 2023 and has not made royalty payments to the royalty holder totaling $1.9 million (US$1.4 million) for 2024.

All defaults have been waived by the lender and royalty holder as at September 30, 2024 and as at November 27, 2024, and the Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to the revision of existing agreements.

Cash and working capital:

Cash and equivalents of $0.3 million as at September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024 : $0.7 million);

Accounts receivable increased by $0.4 million compared to September 30, 2024, as a result of increased sales during the quarter, with days of sales outstanding at 38 days of sales. Inventories decreased by $0.7 million compared to the second quarter. Accounts payable remained stable compared to the end of the previous quarter.

The Company's working capital optimization efforts on inventories and receivables offset by the above noted senior debt and royalty classifications to current liabilities ($31.7 million in total), resulting in a negative working capital balance of $27.6 million as at September 30, 2024.

Northern is continuing to work towards its goal of becoming a vertically integrated, mine-to-market supplier to traditional downstream customers and to the emerging ‎‎market for battery anode material as well as for next generation All Solid State battery chemistries. The main catalysts of the Company's strategy include growing graphite production from our cornerstone LDI mine, restarting the Okanjande mine in Namibia, developing the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario, developing downstream capacity to produce advanced BAM for use in lithium-ion batteries and EVs in North America and Europe, and upgrading graphite mine concentrate into value added industrial products.

Mining Operations

As the only producer of natural flake graphite in North America, Northern has a first mover, competitive advantage in supplying Western markets with graphite for the EV revolution. The Company's projects in Canada and Namibia are all battery grade, and can be scaled in a relatively quick, low-cost manner by leveraging existing permitting and infrastructure at both LDI and at its Okanjande mine in Namibia and the advanced state of the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario.

Lac des Iles Mine - Quebec

Northern is boosting output from the LDI mine and processing plant to meet growing demand from industrial customers and coming demand from North American battery makers. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volume and revenue from LDI have increased significantly, and continuously, up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023. Following the announcement of a temporary shutdown for maintenance during November and December 2024, the Company is continuing to serve its customers from existing inventory and from third parties to avoid disruptions as demand remains significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The LDI mill is forecast to reopen on or around January 6, 2025.

After a new resource estimate in January 2024 showed potential to extend the life of LDI by approximately eight years (to be confirmed and quantified through an updated mineral reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan), the Company has begun permitting to open a new pit in 2025. Northern has also launched an additional drilling program with the objectives of further expanding resources, identifying resources with a lower strip ratio and spending $1.85 million to meet the Company's obligations under its 2023 flow through share financing. According to the mineral resource estimate, prepared in the first quarter by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. and based on the results of a 2023 drilling campaign, Indicated Mineral Resources now total approximately 3.29 million tonnes (""Mt"") at an average grade of 6.4% graphitic carbon (""Cg""), containing approximately 213,000 tonnes of Cg. Inferred Mineral Resources total approximately 1.43 Mt at an average grade of 7.4% Cg, containing approximately 106,000 tonnes of Cg. Existing stockpiles at the mine site are not included in the updated mineral resource estimate. The updated mineral resource estimate assumes an open pit mining scenario and a long-term average flake graphite concentrate market price of US$1,550 per tonne. Mineral resources are constrained within an optimized pit shell at a cut-off grade of 2.3% Cg. A technical report in respect of the mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on March 1, 2024.

Okanjande Project - Namibia

The Company continues to evaluate options to fund the Okanjande project through the use of a royalty/stream/debt structure and equity contributed by a strategic partner without having to go to the market at current share prices. During the third quarter of 2023, Northern placed Okanjande on care and maintenance except for engineering and activities relating to moving the plant from its site at Okorusu to Okanjande. The timing of the restart is subject to the availability of project financing. A technical report in respect of a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") for the Okanjande project prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on August 28, 2023. The PEA indicated that the economics are attractive under a plan to move the processing plant from Okorusu to the mine site with higher capital costs but lower operating costs. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, sustainability is improved, and the expansion potential of the project is substantially enhanced.

Advancing Mine-to-Market Strategy -Partnering for Progress

Northern is advancing its mine-to-market-to-battery strategy and in October reached a milestone partnership agreement with Rain Carbon Inc. , a leading supplier of carbon precursor and carbon products, to develop advanced natural graphite Battery Anode Material that improves the performance and reduces the costs and carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Under the terms of the JDA, Northern and RAIN will jointly develop and commercialize natural graphite BAM products that are engineered to address critical market demands for extended cycle life, enhanced charging speed and reduced electrode swelling in lithium-ion battery cells. The JDA will answer a market need for higher-quality natural graphite anode material that is also lower cost and more environmentally friendly than synthetic graphite, underscoring Northern's commitment to delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that align with the EV industry's evolving requirements and global decarbonization goals.

Northern Graphite JDA with RAIN Process and Product Chart

The JDA with RAIN complements Northern's broader strategy to become a fully integrated mine-to-battery producer and processor of graphite for lithium-ion batteries, employing advanced milling and shaping, purification and coating technologies to produce BAM at scale from a planned 200,000 tpy facility at the deepwater port of Baie-Comeau, Quebec. The plant is planned to be built in modules to de-risk investment and tailor construction to demand growth in EV markets, and is subject to financing, regulatory approvals and certain other conditions. The facility is eligible for assistance under programs offered by the province of Québec, the Canadian and U.S. governments, as well as other assistance by the Manicouagan region and potential Plan Nord incentives. Northern has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations with technology and OEM partners in both the U.S. and Europe who want to collaborate with a quality supplier of graphite that has current production, immediately available inventory and the capacity to support future growth. Discussions center on volume requirements and the timing thereof and plans for downstream conversion facilities in both North America and Europe. Numerous, active discussions are ongoing with respect to strategic partnerships and offtake agreements and there continue to be many positive developments in the EV/battery/critical minerals space. In addition, the Company is working closely with federal and provincial government organizations to gain support to accelerate the development of the battery anode supply chain, with a particular focus on Ontario and Québec.

Northern's battery materials division (""NGCBM""), launched in February 2024 to drive the Company's mine-to-battery strategy, is also advancing in its efforts to commercialize Porocarb®, its patented, high-performance microporous hard carbon material used to boost performance in next generation battery chemistries for electric vehicles, including both lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. The product is currently being evaluated with very positive results by top tier battery manufacturers from South Korea, China and several Western countries. Porocarb® has the potential to provide significant revenue to the Company sooner than natural graphite lithium-ion BAM products.

Market Commentary

Global graphite markets face rising supply pressures amid geopolitical tensions with China, driving consumers to establish secure future supply chains in the West that are less reliant on the world's largest producer and processor of this leading component in lithium-ion batteries. Northern has already seen sustained demand growth and near-record sales to industrial customers since the second half of last year, and those trends are seen continuing into 2025. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate, 58% higher than last year, with an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne, 14% lower than the previous year's period amid inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also expected to be favorable as a result of efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, including further inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Management has been aggressively pursuing new markets/customer opportunities in North America and Europe in order to balance liquidity with the amount of working capital tied up in inventories, and to create a market for future expected Namibian production. While we are still awaiting greater clarity on U.S. trade policy under a second Trump presidency, as a member of the North American Graphite Alliance, which represents North American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, Northern continues to engage with the White House, OEMs and other producers to find ways to protect and stimulate the graphite industry. To date, Canada, the United States and Europe have all announced tariffs on EV imports to support their automotive industries and better compete with China.

Balance Sheet Commentary

Northern implemented strict cost control measures during the second and third quarters of 2024 to better manage its cash position, bolster its balance sheet and optimize its working capital, including sales of inventory, optimization of accounts receivable and operating the LDI mill on a seven-days-a-week schedule. The level of production at LDI since its acquisition has not been sufficient to sustain the Company on a cash flow basis, and operational deficits have been financed by external financings and the sale of inventories. In order to make the Company self-sustaining and meet growing demand stimulated by EV sales, Chinese export controls and US tariffs on Chinese graphite, Northern is working to ramp up output at LDI to nameplate capacity of 25,000 tpy. While the expansion is expected to increase operating income, it also requires an additional investment in a new pit and working capital that is straining resources, and discussions continue around amending the Company's existing loan and royalty agreements, including in particular the senior debt interest which was capitalized in 2023.

The Company continues to report as current liabilities its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as a result of the Company not meeting the following covenants related to these instruments:

Senior secured loan - as at September 30, 2024, the Company had not met some of the covenants in the amended and restated credit agreement dated November 29, 2023, including the payment of accrued interest of $1.6 million (US$1.2 million) due on the semi-annual cash interest payment date; maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, positive working capital; and maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, a minimum cash balance of $750,000.

Royalty financing - As at September 30, 2024, the Company had not met some of the covenants in the amended and restated royalty agreement dated November 29, 2023, including the payment of royalties due during 2024 for a total amount of $1.9 million (US$1.4 million).

The lender and royalty holder have waived all defaults as of September 30, 2024 and as of November, 27 2024. The Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to amending the terms of its senior secured loan and royalty financing to better align with project timelines that have shifted with markets that are evolving at a slower pace than forecast. While these discussions are ongoing, the lender and royalty holder is supportive of Northern's growth plans and is keen to work with the Company to find ways to capitalize on the new resource and extended mine life potential at LDI and allow the Company to benefit from a strong industrial market for graphite in North America as well as coming demand from EV markets.

Going forward, the Company intends to continue to reduce inventories to generate liquidity and maintain strict overhead cost controls that were implemented during the last two quarters of 2024, as well as consider a number of other strategies until support for the only operating graphite mine in North America materializes or markets improve. The Company also continues to seek support from federal, provincial and US government agencies as well as EV and battery manufacturers.

Corporate Update

On October 11, 2024, the Company announced the resignation of Guillaume Jacq as Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), effective November 30, 2024, to pursue other career opportunities. Niall Moore, Northern's Group Controller and a Chartered Professional Accountant with over 35 years of experience, will assume the responsibilities of the CFO role on an interim basis.

In closing, Mr. Jacquemin commented: ""While the current situation is challenging, the long term outlook for our strategy to sell to the EV battery space remains strong and we continue to implement measures to enable the Company to weather the prevailing environment and carry us through until graphite markets recover. We are putting the pieces in place to be ready when markets improve to supply North American battery makers with graphite from our mines, tailored into battery anode material that fits their needs and is sourced close to their end markets.""

Okanjande Project - Namibia

The Company continues to evaluate options to fund the Okanjande project through the use of a royalty/stream/debt structure and equity contributed by a strategic partner without having to go to the market at current share prices. During the third quarter of 2023, Northern placed Okanjande on care and maintenance except for engineering and activities relating to moving the plant from its site at Okorusu to Okanjande. The timing of the restart is subject to the availability of project financing. A technical report in respect of a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") for the Okanjande project prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on August 28, 2023. The PEA indicated that the economics are attractive under a plan to move the processing plant from Okorusu to the mine site with higher capital costs but lower operating costs. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, sustainability is improved, and the expansion potential of the project is substantially enhanced.

Advancing Mine-to-Market Strategy -Partnering for Progress

Northern is advancing its mine-to-market-to-battery strategy and in October reached a milestone partnership agreement with Rain Carbon Inc. , a leading supplier of carbon precursor and carbon products, to develop advanced natural graphite Battery Anode Material that improves the performance and reduces the costs and carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Under the terms of the JDA, Northern and RAIN will jointly develop and commercialize natural graphite BAM products that are engineered to address critical market demands for extended cycle life, enhanced charging speed and reduced electrode swelling in lithium-ion battery cells.

Northern is continuing to work towards its goal of becoming a vertically integrated, mine-to-market supplier to traditional downstream customers and to the emerging ‎‎market for battery anode material as well as for next generation All Solid State battery chemistries. The main catalysts of the Company's strategy include growing graphite production from our cornerstone LDI mine, restarting the Okanjande mine in Namibia, developing the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario, developing downstream capacity to produce advanced BAM for use in lithium-ion batteries and EVs in North America and Europe, and upgrading graphite mine concentrate into value added industrial products.

Mining Operations

As the only producer of natural flake graphite in North America, Northern has a first mover, competitive advantage in supplying Western markets with graphite for the EV revolution. The Company's projects in Canada and Namibia are all battery grade, and can be scaled in a relatively quick, low-cost manner by leveraging existing permitting and infrastructure at both LDI and at its Okanjande mine in Namibia and the advanced state of the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario.

Lac des Iles Mine - Quebec

Northern is boosting output from the LDI mine and processing plant to meet growing demand from industrial customers and coming demand from North American battery makers. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volume and revenue from LDI have increased significantly, and continuously, up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023. Following the announcement of a temporary shutdown for maintenance during November and December 2024, the Company is continuing to serve its customers from existing inventory and from third parties to avoid disruptions as demand remains significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The LDI mill is forecast to reopen on or around January 6, 2025.

After a new resource estimate in January 2024 showed potential to extend the life of LDI by approximately eight years (to be confirmed and quantified through an updated mineral reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan), the Company has begun permitting to open a new pit in 2025. Northern has also launched an additional drilling program with the objectives of further expanding resources, identifying resources with a lower strip ratio and spending $1.85 million to meet the Company's obligations under its 2023 flow through share financing. According to the mineral resource estimate, prepared in the first quarter by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. and based on the results of a 2023 drilling campaign, Indicated Mineral Resources now total approximately 3.29 million tonnes (""Mt"") at an average grade of 6.4% graphitic carbon (""Cg""), containing approximately 213,000 tonnes of Cg. Inferred Mineral Resources total approximately 1.43 Mt at an average grade of 7.4% Cg, containing approximately 106,000 tonnes of Cg. Existing stockpiles at the mine site are not included in the updated mineral resource estimate. The updated mineral resource estimate assumes an open pit mining scenario and a long-term average flake graphite concentrate market price of US$1,550 per tonne. Mineral resources are constrained within an optimized pit shell at a cut-off grade of 2.3% Cg. A technical report in respect of the mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on March 1, 2024.

Okanjande Project - Namibia

The Company continues to evaluate options to fund the Okanjande project through the use of a royalty/stream/debt structure and equity contributed by a strategic partner without having to go to the market at current share prices. During the third quarter of 2023, Northern placed Okanjande on care and maintenance except for engineering and activities relating to moving the plant from its site at Okorusu to Okanjande. The timing of the restart is subject to the availability of project financing. A technical report in respect of a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") for the Okanjande project prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on August 28, 2023. The PEA indicated that the economics are attractive under a plan to move the processing plant from Okorusu to the mine site with higher capital costs but lower operating costs. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, sustainability is improved, and the expansion potential of the project is substantially enhanced.

Advancing Mine-to-Market Strategy -Partnering for Progress

Northern is advancing its mine-to-market-to-battery strategy and in October reached a milestone partnership agreement with Rain Carbon Inc. , a leading supplier of carbon precursor and carbon products, to develop advanced natural graphite Battery Anode Material that improves the performance and reduces the costs and carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Under the terms of the JDA, Northern and RAIN will jointly develop and commercialize natural graphite BAM products that are engineered to address critical market demands for extended cycle life, enhanced charging speed and reduced electrode swelling in lithium-ion battery cells. The JDA will answer a market need for higher-quality natural graphite anode material that is also lower cost and more environmentally friendly than synthetic graphite, underscoring Northern's commitment to delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that align with the EV industry's evolving requirements and global decarbonization goals.

The JDA with RAIN complements Northern's broader strategy to become a fully integrated mine-to-battery producer and processor of graphite for lithium-ion batteries, employing advanced milling and shaping, purification and coating technologies to produce BAM at scale from a planned 200,000 tpy facility at the deepwater port of Baie-Comeau, Quebec. The plant is planned to be built in modules to de-risk investment and tailor construction to demand growth in EV markets, and is subject to financing, regulatory approvals and certain other conditions. The facility is eligible for assistance under programs offered by the province of Québec, the Canadian and U.S. governments, as well as other assistance by the Manicouagan region and potential Plan Nord incentives. Northern has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations with technology and OEM partners in both the U.S. and Europe who want to collaborate with a quality supplier of graphite that has current production, immediately available inventory and the capacity to support future growth. Discussions center on volume requirements and the timing thereof and plans for downstream conversion facilities in both North America and Europe. Numerous, active discussions are ongoing with respect to strategic partnerships and offtake agreements and there continue to be many positive developments in the EV/battery/critical minerals space. In addition, the Company is working closely with federal and provincial government organizations to gain support to accelerate the development of the battery anode supply chain, with a particular focus on Ontario and Québec.

Northern's battery materials division (""NGCBM""), launched in February 2024 to drive the Company's mine-to-battery strategy, is also advancing in its efforts to commercialize Porocarb®, its patented, high-performance microporous hard carbon material used to boost performance in next generation battery chemistries for electric vehicles, including both lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. The product is currently being evaluated with very positive results by top tier battery manufacturers from South Korea, China and several Western countries. Porocarb® has the potential to provide significant revenue to the Company sooner than natural graphite lithium-ion BAM products.

Market Commentary

Global graphite markets face rising supply pressures amid geopolitical tensions with China, driving consumers to establish secure future supply chains in the West that are less reliant on the world's largest producer and processor of this leading component in lithium-ion batteries. Northern has already seen sustained demand growth and near-record sales to industrial customers since the second half of last year, and those trends are seen continuing into 2025. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate, 58% higher than last year, with an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne, 14% lower than the previous year's period amid inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also expected to be favorable as a result of efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, including further inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Management has been aggressively pursuing new markets/customer opportunities in North America and Europe in order to balance liquidity with the amount of working capital tied up in inventories, and to create a market for future expected Namibian production. While we are still awaiting greater clarity on U.S. trade policy under a second Trump presidency, as a member of the North American Graphite Alliance, which represents North American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, Northern continues to engage with the White House, OEMs and other producers to find ways to protect and stimulate the graphite industry. To date, Canada, the United States and Europe have all announced tariffs on EV imports to support their automotive industries and better compete with China.

Balance Sheet Commentary

Northern implemented strict cost control measures during the second and third quarters of 2024 to better manage its cash position, bolster its balance sheet and optimize its working capital, including sales of inventory, optimization of accounts receivable and operating the LDI mill on a seven-days-a-week schedule. The level of production at LDI since its acquisition has not been sufficient to sustain the Company on a cash flow basis, and operational deficits have been financed by external financings and the sale of inventories. In order to make the Company self-sustaining and meet growing demand stimulated by EV sales, Chinese export controls and US tariffs on Chinese graphite, Northern is working to ramp up output at LDI to nameplate capacity of 25,000 tpy. While the expansion is expected to increase operating income, it also requires an additional investment in a new pit and working capital that is straining resources, and discussions continue around amending the Company's existing loan and royalty agreements, including in particular the senior debt interest which was capitalized in 2023.

The Company continues to report as current liabilities its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as a result of the Company not meeting the following covenants related to these instruments:

The lender and royalty holder have waived all defaults as of September 30, 2024 and as of November, 27 2024. The Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to amending the terms of its senior secured loan and royalty financing to better align with project timelines that have shifted with markets that are evolving at a slower pace than forecast. While these discussions are ongoing, the lender and royalty holder is supportive of Northern's growth plans and is keen to work with the Company to find ways to capitalize on the new resource and extended mine life potential at LDI and allow the Company to benefit from a strong industrial market for graphite in North America as well as coming demand from EV markets.

Going forward, the Company intends to continue to reduce inventories to generate liquidity and maintain strict overhead cost controls that were implemented during the last two quarters of 2024, as well as consider a number of other strategies until support for the only operating graphite mine in North America materializes or markets improve. The Company also continues to seek support from federal, provincial and US government agencies as well as EV and battery manufacturers.

Corporate Update

On October 11, 2024, the Company announced the resignation of Guillaume Jacq as Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), effective November 30, 2024, to pursue other career opportunities. Niall Moore, Northern's Group Controller and a Chartered Professional Accountant with over 35 years of experience, will assume the responsibilities of the CFO role on an interim basis.

In closing, Mr. Jacquemin commented:

""While the current situation is challenging, the long term outlook for our strategy to sell to the EV battery space remains strong and we continue to implement measures to enable the Company to weather the prevailing environment and carry us through until graphite markets recover. We are putting the pieces in place to be ready when markets improve to supply North American battery makers with graphite from our mines, tailored into battery anode material that fits their needs and is sourced close to their end markets.""

Northern is continuing to work towards its goal of becoming a vertically integrated, mine-to-market supplier to traditional downstream customers and to the emerging ‎‎market for battery anode material as well as for next generation All Solid State battery chemistries. The main catalysts of the Company's strategy include growing graphite production from our cornerstone LDI mine, restarting the Okanjande mine in Namibia, developing the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario, developing downstream capacity to produce advanced BAM for use in lithium-ion batteries and EVs in North America and Europe, and upgrading graphite mine concentrate into value added industrial products.

Mining Operations

As the only producer of natural flake graphite in North America, Northern has a first mover, competitive advantage in supplying Western markets with graphite for the EV revolution. The Company's projects in Canada and Namibia are all battery grade, and can be scaled in a relatively quick, low-cost manner by leveraging existing permitting and infrastructure at both LDI and at its Okanjande mine in Namibia and the advanced state of the Bissett Creek Project in Ontario.

Lac des Iles Mine - Quebec

Northern is boosting output from the LDI mine and processing plant to meet growing demand from industrial customers and coming demand from North American battery makers. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volume and revenue from LDI have increased significantly, and continuously, up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023. Following the announcement of a temporary shutdown for maintenance during November and December 2024, the Company is continuing to serve its customers from existing inventory and from third parties to avoid disruptions as demand remains significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The LDI mill is forecast to reopen on or around January 6, 2025.

After a new resource estimate in January 2024 showed potential to extend the life of LDI by approximately eight years (to be confirmed and quantified through an updated mineral reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan), the Company has begun permitting to open a new pit in 2025. Northern has also launched an additional drilling program with the objectives of further expanding resources, identifying resources with a lower strip ratio and spending $1.85 million to meet the Company's obligations under its 2023 flow through share financing. According to the mineral resource estimate, prepared in the first quarter by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. and based on the results of a 2023 drilling campaign, Indicated Mineral Resources now total approximately 3.29 million tonnes (""Mt"") at an average grade of 6.4% graphitic carbon (""Cg""), containing approximately 213,000 tonnes of Cg. Inferred Mineral Resources total approximately 1.43 Mt at an average grade of 7.4% Cg, containing approximately 106,000 tonnes of Cg. Existing stockpiles at the mine site are not included in the updated mineral resource estimate. The updated mineral resource estimate assumes an open pit mining scenario and a long-term average flake graphite concentrate market price of US$1,550 per tonne. Mineral resources are constrained within an optimized pit shell at a cut-off grade of 2.3% Cg. A technical report in respect of the mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on March 1, 2024.

Okanjande Project - Namibia

The Company continues to evaluate options to fund the Okanjande project through the use of a royalty/stream/debt structure and equity contributed by a strategic partner without having to go to the market at current share prices. During the third quarter of 2023, Northern placed Okanjande on care and maintenance except for engineering and activities relating to moving the plant from its site at Okorusu to Okanjande. The timing of the restart is subject to the availability of project financing. A technical report in respect of a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") for the Okanjande project prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 was filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) on August 28, 2023. The PEA indicated that the economics are attractive under a plan to move the processing plant from Okorusu to the mine site with higher capital costs but lower operating costs. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, sustainability is improved, and the expansion potential of the project is substantially enhanced.

Advancing Mine-to-Market Strategy -Partnering for Progress

Northern is advancing its mine-to-market-to-battery strategy and in October reached a milestone partnership agreement with Rain Carbon Inc. , a leading supplier of carbon precursor and carbon products, to develop advanced natural graphite Battery Anode Material that improves the performance and reduces the costs and carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Under the terms of the JDA, Northern and RAIN will jointly develop and commercialize natural graphite BAM products that are engineered to address critical market demands for extended cycle life, enhanced charging speed and reduced electrode swelling in lithium-ion battery cells. The JDA will answer a market need for higher-quality natural graphite anode material that is also lower cost and more environmentally friendly than synthetic graphite, underscoring Northern's commitment to delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that align with the EV industry's evolving requirements and global decarbonization goals.

The JDA with RAIN complements Northern's broader strategy to become a fully integrated mine-to-battery producer and processor of graphite for lithium-ion batteries, employing advanced milling and shaping, purification and coating technologies to produce BAM at scale from a planned 200,000 tpy facility at the deepwater port of Baie-Comeau, Quebec. The plant is planned to be built in modules to de-risk investment and tailor construction to demand growth in EV markets, and is subject to financing, regulatory approvals and certain other conditions. The facility is eligible for assistance under programs offered by the province of Québec, the Canadian and U.S. governments, as well as other assistance by the Manicouagan region and potential Plan Nord incentives. Northern has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations with technology and OEM partners in both the U.S. and Europe who want to collaborate with a quality supplier of graphite that has current production, immediately available inventory and the capacity to support future growth. Discussions center on volume requirements and the timing thereof and plans for downstream conversion facilities in both North America and Europe. Numerous, active discussions are ongoing with respect to strategic partnerships and offtake agreements and there continue to be many positive developments in the EV/battery/critical minerals space. In addition, the Company is working closely with federal and provincial government organizations to gain support to accelerate the development of the battery anode supply chain, with a particular focus on Ontario and Québec.

Northern's battery materials division (""NGCBM""), launched in February 2024 to drive the Company's mine-to-battery strategy, is also advancing in its efforts to commercialize Porocarb®, its patented, high-performance microporous hard carbon material used to boost performance in next generation battery chemistries for electric vehicles, including both lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. The product is currently being evaluated with very positive results by top tier battery manufacturers from South Korea, China and several Western countries. Porocarb® has the potential to provide significant revenue to the Company sooner than natural graphite lithium-ion BAM products.

Market Commentary

Global graphite markets face rising supply pressures amid geopolitical tensions with China, driving consumers to establish secure future supply chains in the West that are less reliant on the world's largest producer and processor of this leading component in lithium-ion batteries. Northern has already seen sustained demand growth and near-record sales to industrial customers since the second half of last year, and those trends are seen continuing into 2025. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate, 58% higher than last year, with an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne, 14% lower than the previous year's period amid inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also expected to be favorable as a result of efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, including further inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Management has been aggressively pursuing new markets/customer opportunities in North America and Europe in order to balance liquidity with the amount of working capital tied up in inventories, and to create a market for future expected Namibian production. While we are still awaiting greater clarity on U.S. trade policy under a second Trump presidency, as a member of the North American Graphite Alliance, which represents North American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, Northern continues to engage with the White House, OEMs and other producers to find ways to protect and stimulate the graphite industry. To date, Canada, the United States and Europe have all announced tariffs on EV imports to support their automotive industries and better compete with China.

Balance Sheet Commentary

Northern implemented strict cost control measures during the second and third quarters of 2024 to better manage its cash position, bolster its balance sheet and optimize its working capital, including sales of inventory, optimization of accounts receivable and operating the LDI mill on a seven-days-a-week schedule. The level of production at LDI since its acquisition has not been sufficient to sustain the Company on a cash flow basis, and operational deficits have been financed by external financings and the sale of inventories. In order to make the Company self-sustaining and meet growing demand stimulated by EV sales, Chinese export controls and US tariffs on Chinese graphite, Northern is working to ramp up output at LDI to nameplate capacity of 25,000 tpy. While the expansion is expected to increase operating income, it also requires an additional investment in a new pit and working capital that is straining resources, and discussions continue around amending the Company's existing loan and royalty agreements, including in particular the senior debt interest which was capitalized in 2023.

The Company continues to report as current liabilities its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as a result of the Company not meeting the following covenants related to these instruments:

The lender and royalty holder have waived all defaults as of September 30, 2024 and as of November, 27 2024. The Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to amending the terms of its senior secured loan and royalty financing to better align with project timelines that have shifted with markets that are evolving at a slower pace than forecast. While these discussions are ongoing, the lender and royalty holder is supportive of Northern's growth plans and is keen to work with the Company to find ways to capitalize on the new resource and extended mine life potential at LDI and allow the Company to benefit from a strong industrial market for graphite in North America as well as coming demand from EV markets.

Going forward, the Company intends to continue to reduce inventories to generate liquidity and maintain strict overhead cost controls that were implemented during the last two quarters of 2024, as well as consider a number of other strategies until support for the only operating graphite mine in North America materializes or markets improve. The Company also continues to seek support from federal, provincial and US government agencies as well as EV and battery manufacturers.

Corporate Update

On October 11, 2024, the Company announced the resignation of Guillaume Jacq as Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), effective November 30, 2024, to pursue other career opportunities. Niall Moore, Northern's Group Controller and a Chartered Professional Accountant with over 35 years of experience, will assume the responsibilities of the CFO role on an interim basis.

In closing, Mr. Jacquemin commented:

""While the current situation is challenging, the long term outlook for our strategy to sell to the EV battery space remains strong and we continue to implement measures to enable the Company to weather the prevailing environment and carry us through until graphite markets recover. We are putting the pieces in place to be ready when markets improve to supply North American battery makers with graphite from our mines, tailored into battery anode material that fits their needs and is sourced close to their end markets.""

Operational Highlights: Driving Our Growth Catalysts

To meet increasing customer demand, the Company saw continued strong production volume from the plant at its Lac des Iles (""LDI"") mine for a third consecutive quarter and achieved record sales from June 30 through September 30 after moving to a four shifts, seven-days-a-week schedule. During the first nine months of 2024, sales volumes and revenues from LDI are up by 53 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to the first nine months of 2023;

During the fourth quarter, management made the decision to put the LDI plant under a two-month maintenance shutdown to complete repairs and maintenance and plans to increase throughput to nameplate capacity when it reopens in January. This will enable the Company to meet growing demand for natural graphite sourced outside of China;

After a successful 2023 drilling campaign and a new resource estimate showed potential to significantly extend the life of LDI, the Company started permitting in the fourth quarter to open a new pit in the new year. A second drilling program has also been launched with the goal of further increasing production through successful exploration;

In June, the Company received support from Québec's Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et des Forêts (""MRNF"") in the form of a grant for a total of $0.4 million to pay 50 percent of eligible expenses for geo-metallurgical and geo-environmental drilling to be carried out this year on the LDI mining lease;

In preparation to supply coming demand from North American battery markets, Northern signed a Joint Development Agreement (""JDA"") with Rain Carbon Inc. (""Rain"") to develop and commercialize advanced, natural graphite battery anode material (""BAM"") products used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (""EVs"");

The Company continued development of its battery materials portfolio and advanced discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturers (""OEMs"") and battery makers, and Northern's patented Porocarb® product is currently being evaluated by leading global battery manufacturers with very positive results.

Financial Highlights: Focus on Cash Management

Revenue of $6.7 million based on 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate sold at an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne (US$1,205 per tonne). The average realized price in the third quarter was 17% below the second quarter of 2024, mainly due to commercial efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, which included inventory spot sales for cash management purposes, which have negatively impacted average sales prices and margins;

Cash costs of $1,413 (US$1,035) per tonne of graphite concentrate sold represented a 9% improvement compared to second quarter costs of $1,560 per tonne (US$1,035). Production costs have been negatively impacted by inefficiencies and unexpected breakdowns which have impacted the ability of the LDI plant to ramp up operations;

Loss from mine operations was $0.6 million, compared to income from mine operations of $0.1 million during the second quarter;

General and administrative expenses during the third quarter were in line with the second quarter of 2024, which were 13% lower than the first quarter of 2024 as a result of the implementation of strict overhead cost control measures;

The LDI plant was in full production during the third quarter with production volumes of 3,630 tonnes. Mining operations were stopped on July 15, 2024 and restarted on September 3, 2024 to preserve cash while the plant continued to operate;

Finance costs were $2.9 million, almost all of which were non-cash items;

An impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded due to the identification of variances following a physical count of finished goods inventories;

A net loss of $4.8 million ($0.04 per share) which included significant non-cash charges relating to depletion and depreciation, share-based compensation, capitalized finance expenses, impairment expenses and drawdown of inventories. Cash used in operating activities was $nil and slightly deteriorated compared to the second quarter when cash provided by operating activities of $0.1 million was reported, mostly as an effect of lower average sales prices;

As of September 30, 2024, and in line with June 30, 2024, the Company continued to report its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as current liabilities as a result of the lack of performance by the Company on the following covenants related to these instruments:

Senior secured loan - The Company had not met some of the covenants relating to the amended and restated credit agreement dated November 29, 2023, including:

The payment of accrued interest of $1.6 million (US$1.2 million) on the semi-annual cash interest payment date as of September 30, 2024;

Maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, positive working capital, and

Maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, a minimum cash balance of $750,000.

Royalty financing - The Company had not met certain covenants related to the amended and restated royalty agreement dated November 29, 2023 and has not made royalty payments to the royalty holder totaling $1.9 million (US$1.4 million) for 2024.

All defaults have been waived by the lender and royalty holder as at September 30, 2024 and as at November 27, 2024, and the Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to the revision of existing agreements.

Cash and working capital:

Cash and equivalents of $0.3 million as at September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024: $0.7 million);

Accounts receivable increased by $0.4 million compared to September 30, 2024, as a result of increased sales during the quarter, with days of sales outstanding at 38 days of sales. Inventories decreased by $0.7 million compared to the second quarter. Accounts payable remained stable compared to the end of the previous quarter.

The Company's working capital optimization efforts on inventories and receivables offset by the above noted senior debt and royalty classifications to current liabilities ($31.7 million in total), resulting in a negative working capital balance of $27.6 million as at September 30, 2024.

The JDA with RAIN complements Northern's broader strategy to become a fully integrated mine-to-battery producer and processor of graphite for lithium-ion batteries, employing advanced milling and shaping, purification and coating technologies to produce BAM at scale from a planned 200,000 tpy facility at the deepwater port of Baie-Comeau, Quebec. The plant is planned to be built in modules to de-risk investment and tailor construction to demand growth in EV markets, and is subject to financing, regulatory approvals and certain other conditions. The facility is eligible for assistance under programs offered by the province of Québec, the Canadian and U.S. governments, as well as other assistance by the Manicouagan region and potential Plan Nord incentives. Northern has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations with technology and OEM partners in both the U.S. and Europe who want to collaborate with a quality supplier of graphite that has current production, immediately available inventory and the capacity to support future growth. Discussions center on volume requirements and the timing thereof and plans for downstream conversion facilities in both North America and Europe. Numerous, active discussions are ongoing with respect to strategic partnerships and offtake agreements and there continue to be many positive developments in the EV/battery/critical minerals space. In addition, the Company is working closely with federal and provincial government organizations to gain support to accelerate the development of the battery anode supply chain, with a particular focus on Ontario and Québec.

Northern's battery materials division (""NGCBM""), launched in February 2024 to drive the Company's mine-to-battery strategy, is also advancing in its efforts to commercialize Porocarb®, its patented, high-performance microporous hard carbon material used to boost performance in next generation battery chemistries for electric vehicles, including both lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. The product is currently being evaluated with very positive results by top tier battery manufacturers from South Korea, China and several Western countries. Porocarb® has the potential to provide significant revenue to the Company sooner than natural graphite lithium-ion BAM products.

Market Commentary

Global graphite markets face rising supply pressures amid geopolitical tensions with China, driving consumers to establish secure future supply chains in the West that are less reliant on the world's largest producer and processor of this leading component in lithium-ion batteries. Northern has already seen sustained demand growth and near-record sales to industrial customers since the second half of last year, and those trends are seen continuing into 2025. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 4,080 tonnes of graphite concentrate, 58% higher than last year, with an average realized sales price of $1,644 per tonne, 14% lower than the previous year's period amid inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also expected to be favorable as a result of efforts to sell additional volumes to customers, including further inventory spot sales for cash management purposes. Management has been aggressively pursuing new markets/customer opportunities in North America and Europe in order to balance liquidity with the amount of working capital tied up in inventories, and to create a market for future expected Namibian production. While we are still awaiting greater clarity on U.S. trade policy under a second Trump presidency, as a member of the North American Graphite Alliance, which represents North American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, Northern continues to engage with the White House, OEMs and other producers to find ways to protect and stimulate the graphite industry. To date, Canada, the United States and Europe have all announced tariffs on EV imports to support their automotive industries and better compete with China.

Balance Sheet Commentary

Northern implemented strict cost control measures during the second and third quarters of 2024 to better manage its cash position, bolster its balance sheet and optimize its working capital, including sales of inventory, optimization of accounts receivable and operating the LDI mill on a seven-days-a-week schedule. The level of production at LDI since its acquisition has not been sufficient to sustain the Company on a cash flow basis, and operational deficits have been financed by external financings and the sale of inventories. In order to make the Company self-sustaining and meet growing demand stimulated by EV sales, Chinese export controls and US tariffs on Chinese graphite, Northern is working to ramp up output at LDI to nameplate capacity of 25,000 tpy. While the expansion is expected to increase operating income, it also requires an additional investment in a new pit and working capital that is straining resources, and discussions continue around amending the Company's existing loan and royalty agreements, including in particular the senior debt interest which was capitalized in 2023.

The Company continues to report as current liabilities its senior secured loan ($22.7 million) and its royalty financing ($9.0 million) as a result of the Company not meeting the following covenants related to these instruments:

Senior secured loan - as at September 30, 2024, the Company had not met some of the covenants in the amended and restated credit agreement dated November 29, 2023, including the payment of accrued interest of $1.6 million (US$1.2 million) due on the semi-annual cash interest payment date; maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, positive working capital; and maintaining, at all times, on a consolidated basis, a minimum cash balance of $750,000.

Royalty financing - As at September 30, 2024, the Company had not met some of the covenants in the amended and restated royalty agreement dated November 29, 2023, including the payment of royalties due during 2024 for a total amount of $1.9 million (US$1.4 million).

The lender and royalty holder have waived all defaults as of September 30, 2024 and as of November, 27 2024. The Company is currently in discussions with the lender and royalty holder relating to amending the terms of its senior secured loan and royalty financing to better align with project timelines that have shifted with markets that are evolving at a slower pace than forecast. While these discussions are ongoing, the lender and royalty holder is supportive of Northern's growth plans and is keen to work with the Company to find ways to capitalize on the new resource and extended mine life potential at LDI and allow the Company to benefit from a strong industrial market for graphite in North America as well as coming demand from EV markets.

Going forward, the Company intends to continue to reduce inventories to generate liquidity and maintain strict overhead cost controls that were implemented during the last two quarters of 2024, as well as consider a number of other strategies until support for the only operating graphite mine in North America materializes or markets improve. The Company also continues to seek support from federal, provincial and US government agencies as well as EV and battery manufacturers.

Corporate Update

On October 11, 2024, the Company announced the resignation of Guillaume Jacq as Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), effective November 30, 2024, to pursue other career opportunities. Niall Moore, Northern's Group Controller and a Chartered Professional Accountant with over 35 years of experience, will assume the responsibilities of the CFO role on an interim basis.

In closing, Mr. Jacquemin commented:

""While the current situation is challenging, the long term outlook for our strategy to sell to the EV battery space remains strong and we continue to implement measures to enable the Company to weather the prevailing environment and carry us through until graphite markets recover. We are putting the pieces in place to be ready when markets improve to supply North American battery makers with graphite from our mines, tailored into battery anode material that fits their needs and is sourced close to their end markets.""

inventory optimization,"Hy-Vee improves visibility, delivery performance",Supply Chain Dive,https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/hy-vee-grocery-delivery-efficiency-TMS-manhattan-associates/733922/,"""The confidence that we have in our queuing now has allowed us to make adjustments with our retail window ordering, and really has allowed us to maximize the number of deliveries, the appropriate number of deliveries that are going to each of our stores,"" Beenblossom said.

Hy-Vee had already been utilizing Manhattan's warehouse management system and demand forecasting and inventory optimization platform, but the grocer still required true visibility for its entire supply chain, per Beenblossom. This need led it to incorporate the transportation management system into its technology stack.

The Midwest grocery chain utilizes a complex cross-dock network across multiple facilities, Beenblossom said, making highly accurate cubing a key to boosting visibility and ensuring efficient flow of goods from inbound receipt to outbound delivery.

""And ultimately, this solution has helped us to achieve both of those tasks and has allowed us then to service our stores in a much more efficient manner, with on-time deliveries and better fill rate,"" Beenblossom said of the TMS integration.

As a grocery retailer, Hy-Vee handles many perishable products, from produce to seafood. Such items put a lot of pressure on distribution centers, said Stewart Gantt, EVP of professional services at Manhattan, in an interview with Supply Chain Dive. These facilities must be able to track expiration dates as well as weight, particularly for goods sold based on mass rather than quantity.

The improved visibility Hy-Vee has gained by integrating Manhattan's technology platforms has allowed it to better trace the movement of these time-sensitive goods from distribution centers to stores, according to Beenblossom.",,,,N/A,N/A,Manhattan

The relatively immature nature of the AI market also presents uncertainty. Successfully converting pilot projects into long-term production contracts is crucial for sustained revenue growth. A thorough analysis of C3.ai's ability to deliver on this front is needed to gauge the sustainability of its growth.

Furthermore, achieving consistent profitability is a critical objective for the company's long-term success. The regulatory landscape governing AI data usage and compliance also poses challenges that require careful attention. The current macroeconomic environment could also affect the company's growth trajectory, posing further uncertainty for investors.

C3.ai's revenue growth, strategic partnerships, and innovative technology make it an attractive investment opportunity. Its recent collaborations with Microsoft and Capgemini are particularly promising, as they could significantly expand its market reach and revenue potential. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with the competitive terrain, the relative immaturity of the AI market, and the challenge of converting pilot contracts into steady revenue streams. Despite these challenges, the AI market's projected growth presents substantial opportunities. With its strong technological base and strategic partnerships, C3.ai is well-positioned to capitalize on this expanding market.

At Target, data science drives this precision by leveraging AI and machine learning to optimize operations across its vast retail network. Through fully automated, integrated systems for forecasting, purchasing, and product positioning, Target has significantly reduced manual intervention, enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring seamless product availability for consumers, says Sharad Limaye, Senior Director, Data Sciences, Target. In this editorial interaction, Sharad shares details into how these systems have been implemented, the collaborative strategies that drive their success, and the emerging innovations in AI and data science that are poised to redefine inventory management and demand forecasting for the retail sector

Some edited excerpts from the interview:

How are AI and machine learning models improving the accuracy of demand forecasts?

Given the size and scale of our operations AI and ML models are absolutely critical in improving the accuracy of demand forecasts. Target sells thousands of products in its stores and online via target.com. Generating accurate demand forecasts for millions of item-location combinations requires algorithms that are fast, scalable, explainable and flexible. Target uses Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) for generating highly reliable demand forecasts every single day across various selling channels and across the entire network for short-term execution as well as long-range planning.

ML models have helped significantly reduce the forecasting error and improve accuracy compared to our legacy systems and processes, across all our selling channels

What is the role of data science in optimizing inventory management, from warehouse stock levels to shelf placement in stores, ensuring a smooth flow of products to meet consumer demand?

Data sciences is at the front and center of decision making when it comes to designing and developing solutions for all areas of retail which includes inventory management. Some of the ways in which Data Science is being used:

Data science models are fully embedded in decision making for optimizing inventory flow across the entire supply chain lifecycle. These models generate optimal policies that help decide how much inventory to buy to be placed in the warehouses and how much to be replenished in stores. Having the right balance here is very critical so that you don't buy too much (as storage space is limited) or too little inventory (as it could go out of stock).

Within the stores, space and planning models help better plan and position items in the stores considering the size of the stores, category affinities, expected sales and other operational constraints. Allocating optimal shelf space to all categories is very important to drive sales for Target.

Data science models help make smarter decisions both upstream and downstream ensuring the seamless movement of inventory across the supply chain and in our stores, thereby improving operational efficiency

How has Target implemented fully automated systems for forecasting, purchasing, and positioning, reducing manual intervention and enhancing operational efficiency across the supply chain?

We have built algorithmic solutions and data science models to power a fully automated and integrated forecasting, purchasing and positioning system, that are setting the foundations for modern inventory management at Target.

It all starts with understanding customer demand considering multiple factors around promotions, events, holidays etc. Combining all these factors, ML and deep learning models help us get an accurate estimate of unconstrained demand across our network of 2,000 stores. This feeds into replenishment and purchasing systems wherein different algorithms look at making the best possible decisions under uncertainty. These are complex multi-echelon inventory optimization problems where decisions have to be made for millions of item-location combinations every single day.

The integrations that we have built across our production systems, give us end-to-end visibility on various decisions and events and the flexibility of adding more capabilities and enhancements as we modernize our supply chain. As this has significantly improved explainability of models, it has also helped reduce manual interventions over time which otherwise was very difficult with our old legacy systems.

Can you touch upon a little bit regarding the need for cross functional collaborative efforts in developing and scaling these AI-driven solutions?

Forecasting and inventory management systems are the bread and butter of any retail organization and it requires integration with complex systems that have to work with clockwork precision and are completely synchronized. To make this happen, data sciences works very closely with our partner teams in engineering, product and business to build and scale these models. Bringing in the right process knowledge and experience as well as knowing what capabilities to build with the right level of engineering and science is very critical. The teams work very closely and collaboratively in an iterative way to build these systems. Building large-scale production grade systems driven by AI requires such joint planning and execution,

What are the upcoming innovations in AI and data science that could further enhance inventory management and demand forecasting in the retail sector?

As supply chains become more complex than ever, the speed and accuracy of decision making needs to evolve as well. Simulation-driven optimization, Markov models, bandit algorithms and reinforcement learning are all areas of research that will enhance complex and sequential decision making on problems which are stochastic in nature and algorithms that have to deal with lot of variability.

Leveraging additional signals from operations to enhance intelligence, making algorithms more explainable, faster experimentation coupled with right platforms that operate at speed and scale will all be areas to look forward to, to enhance inventory management and demand forecasting.",,,,N/A,N/A,Target

inventory optimization,How SMBs Can Prepare for Trump's Proposed Tariff Policy Changes,supplychain247.com,https://www.supplychain247.com//article/trump-tariff-supply-chain-resilience-ara-ohanian-netstock,"Netstock CEO Ara Ohanian shares strategies like nearshoring, supplier diversification, and inventory optimization to help SMBs adapt

As global trade policies shift, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are grappling with heightened supply chain uncertainty. Potential tariff changes under Donald Trump's presidency could lead to rising costs and a greater emphasis on domestic sourcing. In this Q&A, Netstock CEO Ara Ohanian explores strategies like nearshoring, inventory optimization, and supplier diversification to help SMBs build resilience in an evolving trade environment.

What's Related

Supply Chain 24/7: How do you foresee Donald Trump's potential trade policies impacting SMBs that rely heavily on international suppliers?

Ara Ohanian: Potential changes to trade policies -- including tariffs and import regulations -- could significantly impact SMBs with international suppliers. If tariffs increase, costs for SMBs, especially those dependent on imported goods, could rise. These additional costs might be passed on to customers, impacting competitiveness in an already price-sensitive market. On the other hand, certain policy shifts could encourage investments in domestic manufacturing, opening new opportunities for businesses to source materials locally. This shift could reduce lead times and increase supply chain stability.

SC247: What are some of the biggest challenges SMBs face when trying to diversify their supply chains, and how can they best approach nearshoring or exploring new suppliers?

AO: American SMBs are increasingly bringing their supply chains closer to home. According to Netstock research, only 25% of U.S. respondents prefer offshore suppliers over domestic ones. However, challenges remain. Raw materials often still need to be sourced internationally, meaning locally-held inventories may need to grow temporarily to offset supply chain variability. Additionally, SMBs lack the capital of larger enterprises, making it harder to afford the upfront costs of shifting suppliers or relocating supply chains.

Ara Ohanian, CEO of Netstock

To effectively approach nearshoring, SMBs can gradually diversify their suppliers to mitigate risk and establish partnerships with flexible payment terms. Implementing inventory management tools unlocks real-time data and visibility, enabling optimized stock levels, accurate inventory forecasting, and improved supplier communication. These tools help SMBs reduce inventory holdings and free up cash tied to excess stock.

SC247: What role does strategic stockpiling play in helping SMBs manage tariff risks, and what are the negatives of this approach?

AO: While excess stock can lead to hidden costs and risks, Netstock views it as an ""unexpected opportunity,"" especially for inventory redistribution. By redistributing surplus stock to areas of demand, SMBs can optimize resources without incurring additional costs. This ensures supply chains meet demand and avoid lost sales using already available stock.

The key to successful stockpiling is inventory visibility. Adopting inventory management tools allows SMBs to spot surplus stock in real-time. With greater visibility, businesses can make strategic stock purchases to prepare for potential tariff increases while minimizing costs and risks.

SC247: Given Netstock's experience managing inventory for SMBs, what strategies would you recommend for companies to build a more resilient supply chain?

AO: 1. Diversify suppliers: Relying on a single supplier or region, especially those outside North America, creates vulnerabilities to trade disruptions. SMBs should establish multiple supplier relationships and explore nearshoring to build redundancy and flexibility in sourcing.

2. Leverage predictive technology: Predictive analytics and inventory management tools enable scenario planning, optimized inventory levels, and proactive risk mitigation. According to Netstock research, nearly 80% of SMBs struggle with insufficient planning and overstocking. With predictive tools, SMBs can act ahead of challenges.

""Open communication channels with key partners, suppliers, and logistics providers help businesses identify challenges early and collaboratively develop strategies to address them.""

3. Maximize inventory opportunities: Advanced AI can analyze inventory data across all locations in real-time, providing actionable insights to prevent stockouts and improve inventory management.

4. Foster collaboration: Open communication channels with key partners, suppliers, and logistics providers help businesses identify challenges early and collaboratively develop strategies to address them.

SC247: Are there specific sectors or product categories that you believe will be most affected by potential new tariffs?

AO: Industries like consumer goods, automotive, and manufacturing could be heavily impacted. Consumer goods sectors, such as apparel, electronics, and personal care, rely significantly on imports from China and may face higher costs. Tariffs on critical materials like steel, aluminum, and semiconductors could increase prices in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Manufacturing, in particular, faces the added complexity of forecasting not only supply and demand for finished goods but also the components needed for future production processes.",,,,N/A,N/A,"China, U.S., Netstock"

Here's why I think C3.ai stock will soar after investors digest the Q2 report.

Filling a critical gap in the AI industry

Building AI software applications from scratch can be incredibly expensive, and it also requires the right talent and expertise. Not every organization has those resources, which is why C3.ai's turnkey applications are very popular in non-technology industries like manufacturing, financial services, and oil and gas.

C3.ai has published a number of case studies highlighting the effectiveness of its software. One American industrial manufacturing company with $30 billion in annual revenue approached C3.ai to help reduce its inventory holding costs. It adopted the C3.ai Inventory Optimization application, which uses data from historical sales and production orders to predict how much product to keep on hand.

The manufacturer was able to reduce its inventory by up to 35% by using the application, which is driving between $100 million and $200 million in annual savings.

Similarly, oil and gas giant Shell has worked with C3.ai for years to monitor trillions of rows of data generated by thousands of items of equipment. It has over 100 AI applications in various stages of development, which help the company do everything from reducing carbon emissions to conducting predictive maintenance, which can prevent catastrophic failures.

C3.ai sells its applications directly to customers, but also through partnerships with cloud giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. During the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended July 31), C3.ai closed 51 customer agreements through those partners, which was a whopping 155% increase from the year-ago period. It highlights the substantial demand for the company's AI applications in the corporate sector.

Revenue growth is expected to accelerate again in Q2

At the beginning of C3.ai's fiscal 2023 year (which started on May 1, 2022), the company announced plans to shift from a subscription-based revenue model to a consumption-based model. The move was designed to eliminate lengthy negotiating processes, allowing customers to sign up more quickly and only pay for what they use.",,"billion, million, million",,N/A,N/A,Unknown

The move was designed to eliminate lengthy negotiating processes, allowing customers to sign up more quickly and only pay for what they use.

C3.ai told investors the transition would lead to a temporary decline in its revenue growth while it shifted customers over to the new model, because it would take time for consumption to ramp up. As expected, C3.ai's revenue growth flatlined within four quarters of the announcement.

However, the company has since recorded six consecutive quarters of accelerating revenue growth, which was the expected payoff from the shift to consumption pricing:

Image source: C3.ai.

C3.ai generated a record $87.2 million in revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter, which was a 21% increase from the year-ago period. It was the fastest rate of quarterly growth in two years.

That acceleration is forecast to continue. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate for Q2 (provided by Yahoo!), C3.ai could generate $91 million in revenue, which would be a 24% jump from the year-ago period. However, C3.ai's guidance suggests revenue could grow by as much as 28%.

C3.ai stock could soar with help from its Q2 results

C3.ai stock is currently down 83% from its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy in late 2020. It was unquestionably overvalued back then, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio surging to around 80.

The decline in C3.ai stock, combined with the company's revenue growth since 2020, have pushed its P/S ratio down to just 9.7 as of this writing. That's a 40% discount to its average of 16.1 since the stock came public:

AI PS Ratio data by YCharts

Since the P/S ratio divides a company's market capitalization by its trailing-12-month revenue, investors will typically pay a premium valuation when revenue is growing quickly. Therefore, I think C3.ai stock could trend higher -- potentially even toward its average P/S ratio -- if the company's upcoming Q2 report shows a further acceleration in revenue growth. If its P/S does reach its long-term average, that would imply an upside of 65% in the stock.

Past performance doesn't predict future results, but C3.ai stock is trading 13% higher since reporting its Q1 results, which might bode well for its upcoming Q2 report.

While there is reason to be optimistic about potential upside for C3.ai stock in the weeks and months ahead, investors should always focus on the longer term. AI could be a multiyear technological revolution, which C3.ai CEO Thomas Siebel compares to the dawn of the internet and the smartphone.

Citing research by Bloomberg, Siebel believes the AI opportunity will be worth a whopping $1.3 trillion by 2032, so investors will have to stick around for the long run if they want to capture as much of that value as possible.

inventory optimization,Forward-Looking Logistics Surge Fuels Supply Chain,expertclick.com,"https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/ForwardLooking-Logistics-Surge-Fuels-Supply-Chain,2024307801.aspx","Trade & logistics will surge in the next few quarters! There are several factors that add up to this surge, yet it flies in the face of corporate mandates for inventory reduction. What disruptions and/or issues will translate into a logistics surge (assuming China & other countries can ramp up?

Key Reasons:

Preparation to reshore, nearshore, friendlyshore, expand manufacturing & vertically integrate

Disruptions Create the Surge

What do all the key reasons have in common? Disruption. Thus, let's step into the details of the key reasons behind the surge.

Manufacturing Renaissance: Due to geopolitical and supply chain risk, the new administration's priority to increase manufacturing in the U.S., and the fact that the total cost of manufacturing in the U.S. for non-labor intensive products that cannot be automated has come into alignment with China, reshoring, expanding manufacturing, and vertical integration will take off. As manufacturing transitions, there will be a logistics surge to plan for the transition without impact to customers.

What Will the Forward-Thinking Executives Do?

Yes, forward-thinking executives will create a trade and logistics surge for the next several months. However, that will be insufficient to ensure success. A little common sense will go a long way. If many manufacturers are increasing orders simultaneously, it will create a bottleneck. Forward-thinking executives would have started to increase orders even before the election outcome to address the likely resurgence of manufacturing, Chinese New Year and probable strike. With that said, we must act rapidly. As much as year-end objectives are likely to be front of mind, if you want stock to be available of products, critical components and core raw materials to sustain your company during the transition, take a straight shot to your Planning Team to get on top of your orders. If you have access to internal manufacturing capability, you will be ramping up production, investing in automation, developing skills, and building organizational capabilities to scale rapidly. You also will increase safety stock of critical items, not all items as you right-size inventory. Refer to our article, ""Inventory Optimization in Full Focus in the Turbulent Economy"" for more information.

Forward-thinking executives will be rolling out, upgrading, and utilizing a SIOP (Sales Inventory Operations Planning) process to stay ahead of changing conditions so that you can make the appropriate adjustments to serve customers and ensure profitable growth. As many companies evolve their supply chains simultaneously, it will impact you.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth or organic growth is organic revenue divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Gross margin, earnings, and EBITDA are adjusted for certain gains and charges, which may include acquisition and divestiture-related items, asset impairments, restructuring, transformation costs, environmental charges, and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS, is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results, business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS, presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges, as well as free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to forecasted GAAP EPS on page 2. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations, reconciliations of forecasted free cash flow and forecasted free cash flow conversion to the most directly comparable GAAP estimates have been omitted. The Company believes such reconciliations would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for these forward-looking measures.

inventory optimization,The Hidden Costs Of Excess Inventory,Market Screener,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TARGET-CORPORATION-12291/news/The-Hidden-Costs-Of-Excess-Inventory-48393686/,"In June of 2022, announced an aggressive campaign to reduce and right-size inventory after building it up during the supply chain disruptions of 2020 and 2021. They took actions across their entire supply chain, including adjusting markdowns to sell through store inventory faster, holding inventory further upstream to pool demand and only deploy it when it was needed, and working with vendors to cancel unneeded orders and shorten lead times. This multi-pronged attack on excess inventory ""laid the groundwork for the recovery and profitability"" of 2023, according to CEO .

After the supply shortages of the early pandemic, retailers have overcorrected, with a dramatic increase in inventory levels that, in some cases, can be seen from space. Across the , average days on hand for retailers has increased by 12% since 2021, and the majority of retailers haven't followed Target's example of rightsizing, resulting in inventory remaining high.

Many companies have delayed taking action as they don't realize the full impact of holding excess inventory, in part because the people making inventory decisions are siloed from those managing holding costs (often from ""temporary"" trucks and overflow storage), shrink costs (sometimes the stock on trucks goes missing), and obsolescence costs (electronics in particular date very fast, to the point that earlier models are worthless several years on).

These costs have risen dramatically in the past few years, and as companies realize the impact these changes are having on their finances, more will make moves to adjust their positions. As they embark on these transformations, it is important to remember that forecasting, inventory optimization, and product lifecycle management are the core to a right-sizing operation, but ensuring processes outside of the inventory team are structured and incentivized to keep inventory low is equally important.

Straying toward overstocking product might have been a good-enough strategy in the post-pandemic era, when retailers were still coasting off pent-up demand and borrowing costs were low, but in the last two years, the fundamentals have changed.

Soaring interest rates have pushed interest costs for retailers up by 40% since 2021, warehouse rents have hit record highs, and warehouse labor rates have increased by 13% since 2021, per the . All these overlapping cost increases results in a total cost of holding inventory which can have a sizeable impact on a company's financials.

This situation is compounded by changing customer expectations. As the 2024 Consumer Sentiment Index finds, customers expect a seamless experience with the right product at the right place, and per the , customers are unforgiving when met with out-of-stocks: two-thirds will pursue a different retailer if the item they want is not available on the spot. This makes reducing overall inventory more difficult, as the cost of a stockout often outweighs the cost of excess inventory, so striking the right balance is critical.

Addressing the underlying problems causing overstock

Ensuring availability while reducing inventory levels isn't possible without an accurate demand plan. Fortunately, over the last decade this space has seen huge leaps in technology and capability, with AI and machine-learning (ML)-enabled forecasting becoming the norm.

AI/ML technology is extremely powerful as a forecasting tool due to its ability to incorporate hundreds of factors including historical sales patterns, new product introductions, promotions, pricing, competitive actions, social media data, and hyper-local weather patterns, just to name a few. This technology combined with the incredible cloud computing power which is readily available lets companies run these intricate analyses on every stocking point which could be in the hundreds of millions for larger SKU-heavy retailers such as grocers.

Leveraging AI/ML capabilities can allow retailers to reduce working capital by 10-20%, reduce store shortages by 50-60%, increase sales by 2-4%, and increase EBIT by 1-3%.

Once an accurate consensus forecast is created, inventory can be optimized based on supply chain factors and constraints including supplier lead time and variability, minimum order quantities, demand variability, lead time to stores, space constraints within the distribution center or store, truck rounding, and a variety of other factors. This is streamlined if there is a holistic inventory platform integrated with the demand-planning platform.

Putting inventory into the right locations is as critical as buying the right total amount. We often see a large chunk of company's slow-moving inventory sitting in stores when they are light on that inventory in another part of the country.

It's also worth analyzing and questioning the constraints that are put on purchasing inventory. Constraints such as minimum order quantity are often flexible through negotiation of a higher per unit price, which may be worth it if a single order represents months of inventory volume. We've seen buyers strike a deal to absorb a huge amount of inventory at a discounted price, but when you consider the true cost of holding that inventory, it's a losing proposition. It's important to instill inventory governance principles in everyone making inventory decisions, otherwise the decisions they make might not be best for the overall organization.

Seeing products through the lifecycle

Too often product is bought without a plan on how to get out of it at the end of its life. Fashion retailers are traditionally the best at this, as the seasonal nature of their business results in costly markdowns for any inventory still on the shelf near the end of the season. However, this skillset is important for all retailers as all products have a lifecycle, and planning for and understanding the impact of liquidation can drive better purchasing decisions up front.

Unfortunately, we frequently see retailers wind up with a large volume of product near the end of its life, often in excess of 52 weeks of supply. For this product, it will take over a year to get back to a reasonable level if you don't take any actions outside your normal sales channels. The easy lever to pull is markdowns and having your salesforce push these products before others, but it's worth exploring other avenues.

Retailers have options across the supply-chain to address inventory overages:

Normal channels: Obviously the best way to get out of excess inventory is to sell it, but sometimes it needs to be helped along. We have seen retailers succeed in moving product off their books through cross-functional collaboration and strong analytical capabilities to decide whether geographic rebalancing, markdowns, or salesforce pushes would be the most effective to get inventory back to a healthy level, or if a more drastic measure is needed.

Upstream: When selling through inventory is difficult, one of the first things to look at is returning inventory to the vendor. This won't work in every case, but depending on the retailer's negotiating power with the vendor, or in situations where the vendor has other customers they can quickly turn around and sell that inventory to, they will sometimes be happy to take a shipment back.

New e-commerce channels: While there is an up-front cost, new e-commerce channels can often provide a way to sell through inventory at a discount, but at a better price than a normal liquidation channel. Retailers can also consider own-brand or industry specific liquidation avenues such as Flashfood, or generalized third-party e-commerce platforms like or .

Liquidation sales: When normal channels are not successful, liquidation through sales to competitors, discount retailers, overseas markets, or to general liquidation providers can enable some cash to be extracted from the inventory.

Destruction: When all else fails, the decision should be made quickly to destroy the product so it doesn't continue to accrue cost while being stored and moved around within the distribution center network, where it takes up valuable space that can be better used for other product. With the increases in warehouse rents and labor rates, sometimes simply holding onto inventory is more costly than disposing of it, especially for the many retailers we've seen use expensive offsite or temporary storage.

Making a move

Macroeconomic changes are causing inventory sitting in stores, warehouses, and rented trailers to weigh more heavily on balance sheets, and there are signs that the consumer is, at this time, more cautious about their spending. In other words, there is no better time to make a plan to draw down your current inventory positions and instill a company-wide inventory effectiveness mindset to ensure investments are made in the best interest of the organization as a whole.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

The Facebook parent's shares are also down since the earnings report as they have lost 3.3% after recovering from the bottom of a 5.3% loss. Its earnings report, like the post-report stock performance, also mirrors the software company's results to an extent. For starters, the social media firm also beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates. It posted $40.59 billion in revenue and $6.03 in earnings per share to beat analyst estimates of $40.29 billion and $5.25. Driving the beat was higher advertising revenue which grew by 18.7% annually to sit at $39.9 billion.

However, while the firm's net income jumped by 35% to touch $15.7 billion, it was the slowest growth in over a year. Additionally, the firm reported that it had 3.29 billion active daily users during the third quarter, which was lower than the 3.31 billion in analyst estimates. Another factor that didn't impress investors was its AI-driven capital expenditure. The firm raised the lower end of its full-year capital expenditure to $38 billion from $37 billion and kept the high end intact at $40 billion. Higher expenditures increase the return that investors expect and reduce payouts in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Consequently, the stock tumbled after the earnings report.

These two AI-driven earnings reports are part of a market that is now facing lower rates, higher growths, and the culmination of a bitterly fought presidential election. In a recent report, investment bank UBS took an optimistic view of the US stock market. It noted that from ""a macro perspective, the combination of slowing but durable economic growth, healthy earnings growth, and continued Fed rate cuts is supportive."" The bank is also optimistic about AI and particularly about the broader category of firms apart from the GPU designer that has seen most of the share price gains so far.

In its report, it notes that ""AI-related companies that span semiconductors, cloud service providers, devices, and data centers account for over one-third of the S&P 500 by market cap. We expect continued growth in AI investment spending to drive revenues and profits."" However, according to UBS, AI is not the only lucrative stock market sector offered by the US stock market. The bank adds that the ""S&P 500 also offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.""

On the topic of interest rate cuts, the report outlines that ""50bps cuts at similar labor market conditions as today have historically been positive for equities."" These labor conditions are determined by the 3-month average for US nonfarm payrolls, and UBS also believes that rate cuts by the Federal Reserve can reverberate across global markets. It notes that ""Historically, Fed rate cuts of more than 50bps when the market was within 1% of all-time highs have been rare. It only happened during the Volcker era in the mid 1980s. The S&P 500 rallied more than 20% in the 12 months following the jumbo cuts. Also, Fed rate cuts tend to reverberate positively across global equity markets, with Asia ex-Japan and emerging markets as the primary beneficiaries outside the US.""

Finally, with the 2024 US Presidential Election over, the bank's report released ahead of the election also commented on the outcomes on Wall Street. It shared that ""S elections are a short-term risk; for instance, if former President Donald Trump is elected, markets may quickly price potential tariffs. However, we would see dips as buying opportunities and recommend gradually phasing in equity exposure.""

Our Methodology

To make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm's top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds that had been invested in the firms in descending order.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

A graph plotting the trends and performance of stocks on the public equity markets.

SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a clean energy products company whose products enable users to manage and operate their solar power systems. Solar power stocks typically tend to do well in a low inflation and low interest rate environment which allows plenty of money flowing into the economy for pricey purchases. Consequently, the fact that SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)'s shares are down 85% year to date is unsurprising as the demand for its products has slowed down significantly and forced the firm to rely on inventory optimization and pricing and promotional campaigns to stem the damage. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)'s situation is further complicated by the fact that it has a global operations base. While the American economy has remained robust, Europe has struggled and ended up further impacting revenues. As a result, sustained economic recovery coupled with a favorable regulatory environment in the US are the keys to SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)'s hypothesis.

SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)'s management commented on slower demand during its Q3 2024 earnings call:

'This quarter, we wrote down $612 million of inventory, of which $536 million is related to our solar business and $76 million is related to our non-solar business. This is a result of our assessment of the outlook for various markets, price reductions and promotions taken as part of the market share recapture initiative as well as other steps taken to focus on core markets and product lines. These write-downs fall into the following categories: First, excess inventory, we no longer expect to sell due to lower demand in the European region which we continue to see in this quarter; Second, the accelerated increase in demand for domestic content which came sooner than anticipated and has reduced demand for some products in our inventory; Third, raw materials related to the above-mentioned SKUs; Fourth, partial write-downs of certain SKUs due to the pricing reductions and promotions that we implemented in Europe as we now anticipate selling below cost.""

Overall, SEDG ranks 26th on our list of UBS' bottom quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of SEDG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SEDG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

inventory optimization,Celsius Holdings Stock at 52-Week Low: What's Next for CELH Investors?,NASDAQ Stock Market,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/celsius-holdings-stock-52-week-low-whats-next-celh-investors,"Celsius Holdings, Inc. CELH, a high-profile player in the energy drink market known for its health-conscious branding, saw its stock dive to its 52-week low of $25.77 on Tuesday, closing the trading session at $26.96. This drop has raised questions for investors about the causes of the decline and whether now is the right time to buy, hold or sell CELH stock.

Shares of CELH have slumped 31.8% in the past three months, much wider than the industry's drop of 1.9% and the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector's decline of 2.3%. The company also trailed the S&P 500's growth of 10.6% during the same period. CELH is trading below its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating potential weakness in the stock's momentum.

With a mix of factors -- from operational challenges to competitive pressures -- contributing to the stock's downward movement, let's delve deeper into what's driving Celsius Holdings lower and whether there are signs of value at these levels.

What's Behind CELH's Significant Pullback?

One of the most significant contributors to CELH stock's drop is the company's recent financial performance. Celsius Holdings reported a steep 31% year-over-year revenue decline to $265.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 due to inventory optimization adjustments from its largest distributor, PepsiCo PEP. This inventory adjustment impacted the company's revenues by roughly $124 million. Although management anticipates better inventory alignment in the fourth quarter, these adjustments signal potential volatility in the company's supply chain, raising concerns about the consistency of future revenue streams.

Broader macroeconomic trends have been posing challenges for companies in the energy drinks market. Consumer fatigue with energy drinks, a shift toward more health-conscious products and reduced discretionary spending are putting pressure on the industry. Declining consumer traffic in some key channels has been weighing on demand for Celsius Holdings. A weaker consumer outlook can impact the company's growth, particularly given its position as a premium brand in the energy drink sector.

Celsius Holdings also faces intensified competition from industry leaders such as Red Bull and Monster Beverage MNST, both of which have significantly invested in sugar-free and health-oriented products. This competitive landscape puts pressure on Celsius Holdings' market share, particularly in convenience stores where foot traffic has declined. The need for aggressive promotional pricing to compete also weighs on the company's margins.

Celsius Holdings faced margin pressure in the third quarter of 2024, wherein the gross margin contracted 440 basis points to 46%. The margin reduction was driven by the full ramp-up of an incentive program with PepsiCo, which is designed to bolster market share but has come at the expense of profitability. Sales and marketing expenses also remained high at 37.6% of revenues, underscoring the company's substantial investment in brand-building. These spending requirements, coupled with competitive pressures, raise concerns over short-term profitability.

Celsius Holdings: What Do Analysts Forecast Next?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current and next fiscal year earnings per share has moved downward over the past seven days. This downward adjustment reflects a negative sentiment among analysts and suggests potential challenges in achieving projected profitability.

Celsius Holdings' valuation continues to be a matter of debate. Despite the pullback in the stock price, CELH is trading at a premium relative to industry peers, which seems difficult to justify given the soft revenues and margin concerns. The company is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 29.50, much higher than the industry's 15.96. Celsius Holdings' Value Score of D further reinforces these concerns.

CELH's Strategic Moves: Paving the Way for Future Growth

Celsius Holdings is intensifying its strategic efforts to recover from recent setbacks. The company is making substantial investments in innovation, branding and marketing, with a keen emphasis on bolstering its competitive edge. By consistently launching new flavors and product variations, Celsius Holdings aims to align with evolving consumer tastes, positioning itself to regain momentum in an intensely competitive market.

A core strength of Celsius Holdings is its extensive presence across major retail channels. The company has secured shelf space in top retail chains, convenience stores and online platforms, broadening its market footprint. The company has strengthened its distribution network through diverse channels, including e-commerce and food service, which make up a substantial portion of its revenue base.

CELH's sales to Amazon surged 21% to $27 million in the third quarter of 2024. Moving on, about 12.3% of the company's total North America sales to PepsiCo in the quarter came from the foodservice sector - including solid performance across workplaces, restaurants, recreational locations, hotels and gaming establishments. Sales to Costco COST advanced 15% in the quarter, demonstrating strong brand affinity across multiple retail environments. This diversified channel strategy supports steady revenue growth, insulating Celsius Holdings from seasonal and channel-specific fluctuations.

Apart from this, CELH has strategically entered new markets in Australia, New Zealand and France, with partnerships like Tesco and 7-Eleven providing immediate access to local consumers. This expansion capitalizes on global health trends similar to those seen in the United States, making Celsius Holdings well-positioned to gain a foothold in these high-growth markets. The entry into the UK and other regions also showcases the company's commitment to international growth, offering a pathway to diversify revenue sources and reduce dependence on the North American market over time.

Navigating CELH Stock: A Guide for Investors

Celsius Holdings presents a mixed but intriguing opportunity for investors. While the company faces challenges in a competitive market, its focus on innovation, brand building and expanding distribution channels demonstrates a strong commitment to growth. However, with the stock trading at a premium and ongoing profitability concerns, investors need to balance the company's growth prospects with the risks associated with its near-term performance. Potential investors may want to wait it out, while existing shareholders may consider holding their positions, given CELH's long-term potential and strategic initiatives aimed at market expansion. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Few stocks have matched its more than 2,000% gain over the last five years as finding a niche in the market and the right distribution partner has produced massive returns for investors.

The frustration comes as investors turned on the beverage stock as a key distributor adjusted its inventory purchase. This significantly reduced what was as much as a 7,200% gain within the five-year period.

Despite such concerns, the buy case for Celsius stock likely still stands, and three reasons explain why.

1. Its niche in a growing industry

Admittedly, Celsius may appear to break an investing rule at first. Former GE Aerospace CEO Jack Welch famously listed as his criteria that a company be the largest or second-largest company in its category. Celsius continues to lag far behind Red Bull and Monster Beverage in terms of market share.

However, unlike competitors, it emphasizes the natural ingredients in its beverages. For the stimulant, it uses the seeds of the guarana plant, which is native to the Amazon rainforest. Its seeds contain over twice the caffeine content of coffee beans.

This approach amounts to a competitive advantage that allows it to reach health-conscious consumers who might feel hesitant to consume energy drinks of any kind. It may even help it compete with more traditional caffeinated beverages like coffee or tea.

2. The state of Celsius' financials

Indeed, the immediate financial results look more like a reason not to buy the stock. For the third quarter of 2024, its $266 million in revenue fell 31% from year-ago levels. Also, even if including the results for the first three quarters of 2024, the fact that its $1 billion in revenue grew only 5% is probably not going to inspire growth investors.

The company cited a ""distributor's inventory optimization"" as the reason for the drop. This distributor is likely PepsiCo, which signed a distribution deal with Celsius beginning in 2022. Even if PepsiCo purchased too much product in past years, it will likely learn from this mistake, making it less of a concern in the future.

Moreover, Celsius has made the most of its past gains based on its U.S. distribution, with international sales making up 5% of revenue so far in 2024. As international sales become more critical to the company, it's likely to reinvigorate growth by focusing more on these markets, which could take the stock higher over the long term.",,"million, billion",,N/A,N/A,U.S.

3. Valuation

Additionally, the recent struggles appear to give investors a reason to buy Celsius stock at a discounted valuation. Indeed, many investors are not going to see Celsius stock as cheap when its P/E ratio is 40. Nonetheless, that valuation is a multi-year low for the company, and considering the long-term growth of the stock, some investors may feel it is worth the premium.

The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5 appears to confirm the discounted valuation. The last time its sales multiple was that inexpensive was in 2020. Thus, the uncertainty over the aforementioned inventory correction could make this an excellent time to buy the stock.

Investing in Celsius stock

Despite what is likely a temporary slowdown in purchases, the state of its business, its financials, and valuation metrics make Celsius stock a buy.

Despite a smaller size, Celsius serves a critical niche in the energy drink industry by taking a nature-based approach. Considering the health consciousness of many consumers, that can not only take share from competitors but open the energy drink industry to a segment it would otherwise not reach.

Moreover, the slowdown in distributor purchases is likely temporary, and Celsius has barely begun to tap the international market, a move that could supercharge sales. Considering that its P/E ratio and sales multiples are at multi-year lows, investors should consider taking advantage of the stock's pullback to add shares of Celsius.

We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to investors. However, investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements, and such statements should not be read or understood as a guarantee of future performance or results.

Such statements are based upon the current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections, as well as the current beliefs and assumptions of management, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed under Item 1A risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These forward-looking statements speak only of day in which these statements are made, and we do not undertake or intend to update any forward-looking statements after this call or as a result of new information.

At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Plug Power's CEO, Andy Marsh.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to share Plug Power's results for third-quarter 2024, and provide an update on the steps we're taking to reinforce our leadership in the hydrogen economy.

2024 has been a particular year, a time of strategic consolidation, and focused improvement. Through a disciplined approach to operational efficiency, financial management and technological advancements, we are a foundation that positions Plug for strong (inaudible) growth and resilience as we enter 2025.

Our focus remains on executing our mission, while staying in line with evolving governmental policy that continue to support the hydrogen economy. Plug Power has navigated a dynamic government affairs landscape over the years to help shape clean energy policy.

We played a critical role in advancing legislation like the investment tax credit under the first Trump administration, a key milestone for our industry. We have been deeply engaged in the development of hydrogen policy with the Biden administration, and we do expect that there will be a change in the political climate. This landscape is not completely clear.

A positive indicator is that Politico has reported that the new administration is expected to continue to support hydrogen and nuclear power. For Plug, an important near term consideration is that we expect guidance on the production tax thread soon, with more favorable terms to accelerate hydrogen projects will be announced prior to year's end.

Additionally, we remain on track with the DoE loan process. Taken together, these policies underscore a supportive foundation for the US hydrogen economy. In Europe, support for hydrogen remains robust.

I recently returned from meetings with European partners, who are increasingly committed to hydrogen as a pillar of the sustainable energy transition. These discussions reinforce Plug Power's role as a global leader, as our missions are aligned with European climate goals and economic vision.

Returning to our operations, our hydrogen production infrastructure in the US is advancing well. Plants in Georgia and Tennessee, along with our joint venture facility in Louisiana are critical to building a secure hydrogen network.

The Louisiana is currently in the commissioning phase, and is expected to be fully operational in the first quarter of next year, further strengthening our supply chain as demand for green hydrogen expands.

Globally, Plug's leadership in Pem electrolyzer technologies continues to set us apart. With 70 megawatts of electrolyzers deployed this quarter alone, Plug is now the largest single deployer of PEM electrolyzers worldwide. Bloomberg recently recognized Plug as the leading provider of green hydrogen solutions outside China.

I also want to highlight that in our application business, we have stalled not yet recognized over 8 megawatts of stationary power systems with energy vault. They are seeing new growth and new customers in our material handling business.

My recent trip to Europe also offered the opportunity to meet with key partners including GAAP, with whom we'll be deploying the world's largest PEM electrolyzer systems starting in April 2025. With Iberdola and bp, we're moving forward on a 25 megawatt order at their Castellon refinery, underscoring our ability to deliver at scale and international markets.

These collaborations coupled with Plug's 8 gigawatts in basic design and engineering package for the electrolyzer market, reflects the strong demand for advanced hydrogen solution, and Plug Power's essential role in enabling global energy transition.

[Edgar] has been down, but today we announced the $200 million convertible deal with (inaudible) capital. Under the terms of this agreement, (inaudible) is committed to a loan position with a conversion price of $2.90, and it's restricted from shorting Plug stock. Our focus remains on minimizing shareholder dilution, by partnering with investors who recognize the company's intrinsic value.

Additionally, we continue to explore debt financing and the sale of ITC benefits to further reduce future equity based funding needs. Q3, we reported revenue of $173.7 million, driven by strong demand for our solutions, particularly within electrolyzer and hydrogen infrastructure.

Our gross margins rose by 37% quarter-over-quarter with gains across our equipment, service, and fuel businesses. We've also reduced cash burn by 27% compared to last quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to cash management and inventory optimization. These improvements highlight our commitment to building a financially resilient company, prepared to grow profitably in a dynamic environment.

As we close 2024, we're confident that the foundation we built this year has positioned us for success. With the strength in balance sheet, strategic global expansion, and working to ensure supportive government policy, Plug Power is poised to capitalize our new opportunities in the year ahead.

Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call over to Paul for a few comments.

Paul Middleton

Thanks, Andy. 2024 reflects a critical inflection point for Plug, and the ongoing transformation of the company. We embarked on a journey a few years ago to significantly broaden our solutions in the hydrogen economy and vertically integrate on our hydrogen supply.

We continue to nurture these offerings while doubling down on optimizing the operations and cash management. During Q3 of 2024, we saw meaningful deployment and sales into the market for many of our new platforms, which has set the stage for continued sales growth in Q4 of '24 and '25 onwards.

In particular is our launch of a broad range of electrolyzer products. Q3 represents a major inflection point in ramping the electrolyzer business, and recognizing the commercial growth in our results.

We've continued to optimize the first global green hydrogen plant in Georgia, which combined with the Tennessee facility provides us 25 ton per day of capacity and close to half our current annual hydrogen needs.

And we have made great progress on the third facility in Louisiana, that will provide us an additional 15 tons per day over the coming months. We continue to focus on optimizing the workforce of the company.

Given the rapid growth over recent years, we have added a lot of resources, and this year we've worked at optimizing that resource pool to maximize leverage. Since January 1, we've reduced the global workforce by over 15% to the Q1 restructuring and ongoing attrition where we've not backfilled.

We've completed many rooftop consolidations, and have additional warehouses and facilities we're in the process of consolidating through our two main manufacturing sites in Albany, New York, and Rochester, New York.

We've adjusted pricing across many equipment, fuel and service platforms, for which benefits can be seen in our Q3 results, particularly for fuel and service. These pricing impacts will continue to positively benefit results as the year progresses, and we get full periods under these pricing measures.

We've increased focus on asset leverage, particularly targeting inventory. We made a lot of investment over the last two years to enable successful launch of these new product offerings. And this year, the focus is on optimizing the these resources, and we expect meaningful reduction in the near term as sales continue to ramp, which will provide a meaningful source of liquidity.

Net cash used in operations combined with CapEx is down year-over-year from lower CapEx, inventory reductions, as well as margin enhancement. We expect the cash burn rate to improve even further over the near term as we continue to curtail at CapEx, and leverage working capital further, and drive additional sales and margin growth.

Turning to Q4, at 2025, we remain laser focused on growing sales and margins improving cash flow. Our strategy includes beginning commercial production, our new Louisiana hydrogen plant, further leverage of our Georgia and Tennessee facilities.

Driving more equipment sales, given our expanded manufacturing capacity, which does not require more investment and provides us an opportunity to readily source 3 to 4 times more volumes.

Continuing driving down costs with further work force and optimization, completing the targeting roof consolidations, driving additional leverage on our material vendors, and driving enhanced fuel network efficiency and service cost profiles.

And lastly, leveraging the price increases and yielding full annual benefits of these continue to expand. In terms of liquidity, our unlevered balance sheet provides opportunities for liquidity from a number of different sources. First, our restricted cash balance continues to release quarterly at $50 million rate.

We've discussed at length the opportunity to leverage inventory. We're targeting additional reduction of $200 million to $250 million in the near term. Sales growth, price increases, improved mix, and continued cost downs will continue to improve operating cash flows.

And we've been pursuing various debt facilities and parties interested in equipment findings that we could expand on the platform, like we established earlier this quarter with Hampton.

Lastly, we're working closely with the DoE to finalize the $1.7 billion loan facility. We've made tremendous progress, and we meet with them regularly. We're targeting to close in the near term, and we're extremely clear on the access and the process to successfully close this facility.

I'll now turn it back to Andy.

(Operator Instructions) Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer.

Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys. Just looking at the balance sheet, guys, can you talk a little bit about how quickly you can start monetizing the inventory here for the balance of the year, and into the first part of next year?

Andrew Marsh

Sure, Colin. Great, good morning. I'm going to turn that over to Paul.

Paul Middleton

Yeah, obviously, one core facet of that is sales. And so you see some of that benefit start to be realized with Q3, and based on our guidance, you can anticipate much bigger Q4. So we're definitely expecting even more benefit in that reduction in Q4.

And we're working with the teams to continue that leverage. We have additional reductions in leverage anticipated for the first half of next year. So you should see continued meaningful reduction in that, leverage on that in Q4 and onward.

Colin Rusch

Okay, thanks. And then on the restricted cash balances. Obviously there's a variety of covenants that I'm sure you guys are working through. Can you just give us a sense of whether any of that restricted cash could loosen up here in the near term, or if that is not a real strategy that you guys are thinking about?

Paul Middleton

Yeah, we definitely work in multiple angles on that. And there are couple of routine servicing of those facilities which has our normal reduction releases. We also have a number of transactions we're closing that will release different pockets of those reserves, probably a little bit faster than that in some cases that $50 million per quarter.

But we're also working angles like what we did with Generate a few years ago, where we can actually back lever that, because it's effectively a deferred receivable. So it's a meaningful asset that parties like Generate definitely see value in it. And we definitely think there's opportunities to factor that deferred receivable effectively similar to what we've done.

Good morning. Do you see additional price hikes for the rest of the year or '25? And I guess what are you seeing as your path to positive growth margins, what could drive that?

Andrew Marsh

So I'm going to address price hikes. And then I'll let Paul talk about driving to positive margins. Now, I would say that we have had significant price increases with many of our customers. Some of the legacy deals, especially in the electrolyzer business are almost completed, and all future deals are being priced at a profitable level.

I think a wild card in price increase is for the future will be if there is additional inflationary pressure in the US because of tariffs. So we are primarily a US manufacturing business. It is something that will be conscious of aware of if we need to increase pricing because the inflationary environment change. But at the moment, I think the work we're doing to make sure we price everything profitably, we work on cost reductions well positions the company.

I'll let Paul add on to that.

Paul Middleton

Yeah, I think Andy touched on a real important point that as you work through the backlog and you start layering in the new programs that have all been launched better pricing, both material handling and electrolyzers and other businesses that the mix continues to grow and get better and you see more accretion from those events as that happens.

And but if you look at '25 and onward, we'll be talking a lot about this tomorrow in the Symposium. It's the fundamentals, it's the sales volume, it's driving down material cost, it's continuing to optimize the workforce.

It's all the things that we've done really in material handling, and we're now doing in these new platforms that those themes you'll continue to see continued progression and margin, and we expect that to see. You definitely going to see that. Well, we certainly expect we'll see that in Q4. And we would expect you're going to continue to see that in Q1 onwards.

Exactly, yeah. And that's a combination of volume price increases, leverages of BTC, a lot of factors that are working in towards our benefit, and you see those things continue into Q4.

Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe as a first question, I'd love to ask a little bit about your views on the changing regulatory landscape in the United States, and how that impacts the way you think about the company sort of at an existential level.

In other words, do you see opportunities to really grow in other parts of the world to kind of push the company forward into more into Europe and maybe other parts of Asia? Thank you.

Andrew Marsh

So I'm going to touch on two layers here. Let me talk about US policy, and there was a -- you probably saw the Politico article about hydrogen nuclear power, SAF, people expect that to be continues to have support in the new administration.

If you kind of look at the issues, first there are well called the regulation in the landscape with PTC. We expect it to lighten up before President Trump takes office. But also when you look at the local decision, and you think about what it really say -- what the law really says, we expect that there could be greater opportunities with the PTC.

Look oil and gas likes hydrogen, and that has sometimes been a disadvantage for Plug and sometimes been a benefit to Plug. I think when you look at the DoE loan, we have a clear path with the DoE to close that out before change in administration. I'm not going to go into specifics here, but we know the details and the plan.

I think when you look at grants, we had a good deal of grants last year. And most of those contracts were -- I think with the contracts where we are the prime were closed by October 1 for the manufacturing grants. And look, we help create jobs.

I also think that we are the US manufacturer who's competing against China around the world. And regardless of one's views of whether there should be a trade war or not, our relationships with the opportunities that the American made, building American products, hire American people, work no matter what administration you're playing.

When I span the world, if you look at our electrolyzer deployments, most of the activities happening in Europe and Australia, and parts of our -- we have built for electrolyzer business worldwide capabilities with the integrators to build our electrolyzer products as well as you can see easily our stationary products, and even our hydrogen infrastructure.

That kind of that -- whether it's a Biden administration or whether it is a Trump administration, localization is important. And look, most of those stacks will come from the United States. But we really do have a international footprint, primarily in Australia.

If you look at the 8 gigawatts of basic design and engineering drawings we're working on, most of that works in Europe and Australia. So that's a -- I'm not naive to think that there aren't going to be challenges.

But we worked with the President Bush's administration, we worked with President Trump's administration, we worked with Republican Congresses, we worked with Democratic Congresses and we'll continue to do that.

George Gianarikas

Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up, can you possibly share some more details on the convert that you referenced during the call? (multiple speakers)

Sure. And we're working on getting it posted on our website for more information, and hopefully the (inaudible) system gets up quickly that it'll be public in that forum. The net of it is it's a $200 million unsecured convertible with the fixed conversion price at INR290 million, which is close to 46% premium off of where the share price is now.

It's 24 months at 6% interest rate. And I think really equally important is that the fund has a long view on Plug, and has agreed not to short the stock because they certainly have a very -- a positive outlook that you can tell from the premium they expect where things are going to go with us over this duration. So more details to follow, but those are some of the key details of the deal.

Good morning. Hey, so when I look at the fourth quarter guide, seems to me that it's a little wider than maybe it would typically be just curious. Can you talk to kind of what's in there for the low end? What gets you to the high end?

And then I guess my follow up would just be, I know you had electrolyzer sales in Q2, which a good portion of those were not recognized. We're in Q3, just curious how much of that is left and will impact Q4?

Andrew Marsh

So in many ways, Eric, we're moving -- now we're doing the -- for the electrolyzer products, most of that's been recognized from Q2. There may be some final commissioning activity which may represent about 15%, and maybe one deal that maybe hasn't been, but most of that's been recognized.

And Eric, we expect that the electrolyzer business will be higher in the fourth quarter, just because we're now doing the commission -- integration and commissioning of products that most products which are manufactured in the third quarter and being shipped.

So that's -- so when you take a step back about what we expect in the fourth quarter, I think three items come to mind. One is that the liquefier world is a one zero world, and one zero world, we don't really go for -- the probability of event happening is either $40 million or zero million. So that kind of drives a certain range in that business.

The second item that if you really look at it, the electrolyzer funnel was strong, but as we learn to how we go about recognizing revenue as we did in the second quarter, that is not as large as we thought, even though the activity associated with preparing for the first quarter 2025 is pretty large. We expect it again the electrolyzer business to continue to grow.

And in the apps business, look, material handling is improving when I look at what we have coming in the fourth quarter, and we expect that will be on that 20% to 30% growth path come 2025. That's kind of a summary of what I see Eric.

Hey, good morning, Andy and team. Thanks for providing all the details here. Maybe following on the question on the range of outcomes. I guess within your base case and assuming mix, how should we think about the exit rate of gross margin in the fourth quarter, and maybe also taking account of any sort of cost reductions you're able to provide. And then specifically, how do we think about gross margins in your fuel business?

Yeah, appreciate that. So tomorrow, we'll be given a lot more detail Bill on kind of what we see for '25 and onward, and give you more color. But specific to Q4, I would say this, we definitely as you can tell, expect more sales volume, that helps a lot.

We have a lot of capacity, and leveraging that will drive better product margins. And as we continue to ramp that up, I think I wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't be directionally consistent with the kind of improvement you're seeing from Q4 -- I mean, I'm sorry, from Q3 to Q2 in terms of directional improvement quarter-over-quarter, could be better at the upper end of that guidance.

And specific to fuel, you can see in the numbers that we've disclosed that it's continuing to progress in the right direction. So we still have opportunity to leverage even more out of our facilities that we have.

And we're also looking at mix opportunities where we can even sell more into the direct merchant market, even better pricing. So we're looking, and we're driving even enhanced efficiency measures.

And so we should see the combination of additional pricing benefits being that have come off over the last three months, and being recognized in Q4 as well as the benefits and efficiency, and leveraging the plants, and some of that mix on the fuel side. So it should continue to improve meaningfully in Q4 and then onwards.

Bill Peterson

Yeah, thanks for that Paul. And then I might have missed it, but I guess to the extent that you can speak to, how much is left to be done on the DoE loan closing conditions. Is there any sort of long hold, I guess in particular for Texas, it seems likely is going well but -- or maybe on the capital side, is there any additional capital on top of what you just announced today, or as a DoE looking at further contingency or reserve requirements.

Just trying to get a sense of what is remaining to be done, and at what time you're thinking as of now?

Andrew Marsh

Yeah. So Bill, I know -- I'm going to let Paul talk about process we have going on looking for equity partners, but that is not tied to the DoE loan. And I know everybody would like me to provide detail by detail.

All I can say to you is that we know we don't see any tall pole in the tent. We know how to execute against it. We've worked with the DoE on making sure there's a clear schedule of events, and certainly the election in some ways help to structure a schedule that allows us to get there.

I'll let Paul talk about the process that we're not dependent upon it. But the process we're using to look to bring in an equity investor also, sit side by side with us at the project level.

Paul Middleton

Yeah, we've kicked off. I think we've talked about a parallel process that looking at strategic and project finance funds and others that could be interested in participating in the capital stack for our pipeline. That's going very well.

We've had a number of partners express interest, and we're engaging in those dialogues. Actually, some of those partners will be at our Symposium tomorrow to learn more about the company, and learn more about what we're doing there.

So I would say the theme is that they look at this, the commercial proposition of what we're doing in Georgia, and what we're forecasting to do out of Texas, and that's very attractive. In addition to the fact the DoE is postured with this facility to provide incredibly low cost capital for the majority of that pipeline

So that those factors in addition to the success of us executing on delivering on Georgia, all bode well, and it is what's driving a lot of interest in this to move forward. So very encouraged and we're working hard at bringing all those things to fruition, and more to come in the near term.

Bill Peterson

Thanks, Andy and Paul. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Hey Andy. So I'm going to ask a tough question because I know a lot of the investors out there are really looking at it from the standpoint. And I guess it's best to answer these questions in public when we can, right?

I hate to be the one that brings this, but it hopefully lifts the dark cloud, right? So in the event that we do not see the DoE loan funded, how much flexibility do you have to sort of restructure the operations and pivot, versus the business plan you've been working on this last year.

You guys have shown a continuous ability to raise capital. So congratulations on the $200 million this morning. You still have substantial cash tied up in the PPAs. What do you feel about the flexibility to take a slightly different path than what you've already laid out for us?

Andrew Marsh

Yeah. Craig, we've obviously looked at the different road maps. And if you think about the business in '25 and most of '26, whether Texas is online or not, is not going to impact our financials.

And I can say that there are European funds, people who I worked with for a long time, who would be interested in being joined equity providers in Texas with us. And look, if you look at Texas, we have the equipment already. It's essentially building out the plant.

From a project point of view, would be much better to have the DoE loan. But there would just be an increased effort and activity to bring in an equity partner, if Texas doesn't happen. And look, it doesn't dramatically change the next two years.

I think if you take a step back and look where the business growth was this quarter, if I look at over the last 18 months, I've been in Europe for 10 years and I doubled the number of installations in Europe for material handling in the last 18 months.

If you look at most of the electrolyzer revenue, it's flowing from international activity. If you look at the growth possibilities, much of its outside the US and much of its planned outside the US. And I mentioned on the call earlier, I don't think anyone has the integration capability that Plug has established through our acquisition of folks in the oil and gas industry.

We have top notch integrators in Vietnam. We have top notch integrators in Dubai, we have top notch integrators in Europe. So I think that the pivot will probably have more of an international flavor if the US policy is more negative than we expect. I think I mentioned on the call to the Trump administration was helpful the first time around.

I think the overturned Chevron is certainly helpful. So, I guess, been watching elections since 1968, when I was a young kid. And it's how life plays out is usually in America things tend towards the middle.

Craig Irwin

I would definitely agree with that. Thank you. So my next question, if we look back in history of Plug, right, to your success -- your early success with Walmart, you would never have been able to have the tremendous success, tens of thousands of forklifts operating every day unless you were able to save your customers money with these products, deliver reliably in a more environmentally sound package, and save them money.

Now, in the last several years, we've looked at different pieces of the business model, and you've invested a lot of capital in some of these opportunities. Do you still see the same opportunity to save your customers money in things like electrolyzers, in things like heavy transport trucking. And some of these other applications that we've talked about on and off in this last 10 years.

Andrew Marsh

Okay. I've let my buddy Sanjay not have to speak during this call. I'm going to give him an opportunity to speak up. All I can say is that I'm going to touch on electrolyzers, and I will let you expound. I mean to me, electrolyzer is all about efficiency of the stacks and construction costs, and the price of electricity. So I'll let you run on this point.

Sanjay Shrestha

So Craig, I think your question is the right one, right? There's many instances where we're working on some pretty large mega deals as Andy referred to on our 8 gigawatt of basic engineering design packet.

And the electrolyzer offering is in pretty large scale. And by the way, we're being able to talk and have a very healthy discussion with some of this customer because it's basically for a lot of different kind of hydrogen derivatives.

If you would sort of like things like e-fuels, ammonia, where electrolyzer combined with the right source of power, combined with right efficiency, yes, does allow them to provide a very, very attractive economic value proposition, right? That's item number one.

Item number two is when you touched on this a little bit. But let me elaborate on this a bit. So when you talk about sort of the heavy duty mobility market, we have actually introduced this mobile refueler product, which is a perfect solution because the entire infrastructure of hydrogen fueling actually gets built, right.

So it's almost like hydrogen on wheels if you would. And that's a product that allows them to do a lot of testing faster, allows them to really roll out a lot more vehicle faster, even before the entire infrastructure kind of comes into play, right?

Then when you start thinking about our liquify business, while it's been slower, we haven't lost any opportunity really. It's just that project haven't moved faster. And even with that offering, we have one of the best energy efficiency solution in the market.

So even from that perspective, as you go from gaseous hydrogen to liquid hydrogen, we're really providing a better economic value proposition for our customer, right? And Craig one final thing that I think we'll be able to do here, we kind of think of this as like a facility sales where by providing a combination of our electrolyzer, our liquefaction technology, our hydrogen fueling solution, whether it's hydrogen trucks or the storage.

By giving all that entire offering as an enterprise sales and a facility sales, we can do a lot of optimization from a design standpoint, really continue to drive the cost and increase economics and benefit for our customer, right?

So I think there's a lot of situations where it's really cost savings and a better value proposition for our customer, and that's what's going to drive the growth for us.

Craig Irwin

Excellent. Then last question, if I may. There's been some really interesting things that have come across my desk in the last 25 years, right? So green hydrogen is interesting, and looks like it could be a phenomenal business over the next number of years.

But something that probably has a much longer gestation period is the use of small nuclear reactors for direct production of hydrogen. Now, you guys get approached by pretty much everybody in the market since you are the market leader.

Do you see any potential breakthrough hydrogen production technologies that could be available in the next decade that could bring down the cost of energy production by an order of magnitude.

Andrew Marsh

So that's a interesting question. I'm going to let Sanjay take a shot at it. Maybe I will add on when I get done, Sanjay.

Sanjay Shrestha

So Craig, when you start to think very further out if you would, right. So when we start to -- even before I come to your small module or reactor question, obviously, that's become a bit of a topic to draw here in the near term, right?

When you really think about our electric grid, the challenges with our electric grid, right, the amount of the renewables that's already on the electric grid, and how we're going to keep adding more of that, right?

The pathway to really getting to a grid that keeps becoming more and more renewable is really going to have to go through hydrogen, right? Because I think hydrogen can be an energy carrier, it can be an energy storage.

Then all of a sudden when you think about some of the stranded renewables, potentially even at negative clearing price, you use that to produce hydrogen. And you put that hydrogen via pipeline or in Salt Cavern, which by the way, from a cabin perspective is not that expensive to store that hydrogen and you can store a lot of it, right?

Then you can turn around and use that hydrogen in terms of our stationary product, if you would. And by the way, our working view right now is electrolyzer drives a tremendous growth for our company until the end of this decade.

And somewhere in that time frame, our stationary product will start to have a major inflection point of growth, right? So this is where you can actually envision a world where we can head down the path of almost 100% renewable electric grid here in North America.

Hydrogen plays a major role. Our stationary product starts to play a major role, not just for the data center or the EV charging opportunity, but even for the peaker plant, right, even ends up becoming a baseload with the right cost of hydrogen where grid ends up becoming a backlog, where it starts to become super exciting.

But as it relates to the small modular reactor, Craig, I mean, you know this quite well, from the levelized cost of hydrogen perspective, it's really all about levelized cost of that electricity, right? As scale grows as there is more and more of that, and as the installation becomes larger scale becomes larger, if the LCOE of that small module reactor ends up becoming attractive, then certainly it could be a very big and an attractive combination between that as well as producing green hydrogen is how we would think about it.

Andrew Marsh

I would just add, Sanjay. I kind of have a view very similar to you with the world where hydrogen is being generated when loads -- when they need to put that load on the stabilizing the grid. Or if you start thinking about where the -- then it becomes a capital cost issue, and the efficiency of the electrical is stack issue.

And we do have road maps to continue to drive towards that peak maximum efficiency of 37 kilowatt hours per kilogram. And there's lots of R&D, and a lot of the work our team does is really how to improve the efficiency of the stack.

The other is how do you make systems which are legos, so that there's very, very little construction on site. So I think you'll see learning curves of 20%, 25% for electrolyzers from a total offering, when you put construction site, and improvement in efficiencies.

And then couple it with the how to generate hydrogen off hours. Coupled with that Craig, and I mean, Sanjay's (inaudible) is that driving station product efficiency up is also that whole efficiency game is really the heart of what make electrolyzers work, and what make fuel cells work to improve the value proposition to all potential customers.

Craig Irwin

Understood. Well, thank you for that, and I look forward to tomorrow.

(Operator Instructions) Dushyant Ailani, Jefferies.

Hi, thank you for taking my question. Morning. Just wanted to quickly ask on the plant maintenance for Georgia and Tennessee. It just given the recent start up, could you just share a little bit about what the maintenance involved, and how do we think about maintenance guidance going forward.

Andrew Marsh

Yeah. I think, nothing astronomically is surprising. I think like most plants of this nature we have, I think we had to shut down in early October for general maintenance, which lasted about a week, and we'll have like most folks running facilities of this nature, shutdowns that'll last 7 to 10 days during a year, probably twice a year.

We just got done through one in Tennessee. It's pretty much normal routine. I think the important item is to make sure that we did this during the Georgia and Tennessee is make sure we maximize local storage during that time. And so that the storage on site will provide a sufficient back up during the time we're going down for outages.

Dushyant Ailani

Got it. That's helpful. And then just the second one on the ITC transfer monetization. I think you guys have previously talked about roughly $31 million, and then I think a total of roughly $70 million. Just wanted to check on the timing of that. And how do you see that shaping out?

Yeah. Sure. So we're working diligently on it. It's difficult because it's never, it's like a lot of things Plug does the first time. It just is taking longer than we hoped. But we actually have multiple parties that have expressed interest, and we're nurturing those conversations.

I think there's still a relatively good chance we can get it done in the coming weeks, and there's meaningful additional buckets of opportunity there on the heels of this first one. And we've got one of the top tier broker firms in the US engaged who handles the Texas equity monetization for many companies that's working with us. So I'm very optimistic that there's we could do it and potentially even four year end, if not, even sooner.

Good, good. I wanted to just ask about the DoE in other way. Given the pending change in administration, wanted to get your thoughts on perhaps like the durability of the loan. Like do you need to reach financial close in order for it to be considered safe, or is the conditional commitment -- like can the conditional commitment be canceled?

Andrew Marsh

Yeah, I would just say we are laser focused with the DoE to close before the change of administration. And from my discussions with the DoE, I feel quite comfortable, but I'll let Paul add anything he thinks we should add.

Paul Middleton

Yeah, I guess I would just say so the way, and this is in the words of them, with the commitment the federal government has committed the money to the program. So this is more about execution of the documents. It's not necessarily something that it's absolute that we have to do it before, but it obviously would be a lot easier and good for everybody to get this behind us.

And so it's a meaningful thing for Plug, it's a meaningful program for them. And everybody is focused on getting this done as quickly as possible. And it just be in some ways more simplistic for us to get it done quickly.

But the critical thing for me is that we're really clear on all of the final steps here, and there's a pretty good alignment. And as Andy said, we've got a really good detailed plan with all the final things that have to happen, and there really engaged.

I mean, the amount of energy and support they're providing to help us get this over the finish line is magnified and really helpful. So I'm excited and optimistic. We're going to get this done beforehand, and we'll continue to provide updates as we see that unfold.

Chris Sung

Okay, thanks. And just one more for me. I know it's probably the last time we're going to hear from you guys before the 45B rules are finalized.

Oh, yeah. And we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Andrew Marsh

Yeah, we actually have some real experts that'll be there tomorrow who are Republican lobbyists and Democrat lobbyists. And you'll get to hear from them. But sure, what's the question.

Chris Sung

Just like what would like Plug's ideal final rules be, is it loosening additionality, time matching? What would you guys want?

Andrew Marsh

Well, we believe as many of the senators who wrote the bill that additionality is not in the legislation, and additionality should not be part of the rules and regulations. I think on time matching, we'd be very comfortable looking like Europe where it's 2030, 2032, where it fully takes in.

I think that again, time matching, it's really questionable whether that was part of the legislation. And I think regionally, we like to see about four or five regions across the United States, and that probably would be the ideal situation.

I think our view all along has been the administration should follow the law instead of interpreting positions which were not part of the congressional intent. So that would be the ideal situation for Plug. And I got to tell you that's probably one of the reasons I mentioned that because of (inaudible) we think anything that's different probably will be challenged by others.

Chris Sung

(inaudible) Appreciate the color, thanks and look forward to seeing you guys.

Yeah. So with respect to this 8 gigawatt BEDP contracts that you have, what's the delivery time line for these contracts? Is it like next 12 to 24 months or maybe longer?

So, I mean, it all varies, right? So I think what you should expect however though, and out of that 8 gigawatt, we certainly believe that there is more than a gigawatt that likely gets to FID and goes from being basic considering design packet to actual new orders and bookings sometime in 2025.

And keep in mind, we're going to keep adding to this 8 gigawatt. This number is not going to stay stagnant, right? And I'm sure there'll be some that are going to drop out as well. But that's how you should think about it in terms of how this goes from sort of like the front end study to getting to full feed study, detailed engineering design, then getting the final investment decision, and we've actually identified quite a few of those opportunities that we believe talking to our customer does get to FID in 2025 and becomes a bookings opportunity.

Amit Dayal

And Sanjay, is that 8 gigawatts? I know it's early stage overall, but is that dependent on any sort of regulatory incentives, et cetera, to materialize in a complete manner.

Sanjay Shrestha

Yeah, in that entire 8 gigawatt of basic engineering design packet, I mean, a lot of that as Andy referred to earlier, right? Majority of that is really in Europe and Australia where so the policy here in the US doesn't really have any interplay with that.

We do, however, have about 300 megawatt of opportunity related to the US market, could actually get pushed to the right or that could actually need some further clarity. But out of that 8 gigawatt, for example, there is a 3 gigawatt opportunity in Australia, there is another 1.5 gigawatt opportunity again in Australia, there's 500 megawatt opportunity out of that 8 gigawatt that's in Europe. So most of this mix is really Europe and Australia if you would, in terms of what makes that up.

Amit Dayal

Thank you. And maybe Andy, this last one for you for me. Do you see nuclear as a competing energy source relative to hydrogen, or should we think about how hydrogen and nuclear can power sort of different applications, and be designed for different purposes.

How do we see because it's going to take time for nuclear to come about as well. So it's not a near term threat, obviously, but longer term how do you see nuclear hydrogen sort of co-existing?

Andrew Marsh

I actually see as a good thing. I kind of view them as complementary. Sanjay talked a great deal about how to use nuclear power to generate hydrogen when demand is low. Even though with the new nuclear power devices, you're able to ramp up and down.

Certainly you want to generate as much electricity as you can to support the network. And I think you have a combination of hydrogen being generated all hours, which it was important for us to drive down equipment costs as well as construction costs to make sure that hydrogen is low cost as possible.

Feeding station sharing products which would replace gas turbines to put power on the grid during peak hours. We did a lot of work with the one of the leading consulting firms in the world, who really believe electrolyzers or the big market opportunity for Plug today and during the rest of this decade.

But as those electrolyzers get deployed and the state sharing products become more and more efficient, they are the replacement for gas turbines. And I think in -- we have some activities going on, kind of in the '28 time frame, which can tap into hydrogen pipelines and data centers.

And actually, I think that'll be kind of the first view of what that world will evolve into. So during the next five years, electrolyzers for generating hydrogen for substitution in ammonia markets, in refineries and concrete manufacturing, all work that we're doing today.

But ultimately, I'm a real believer in nuclear. It's really nuclear and hydrogen and fuel cells and solar and wind, which make the grid up ultimately.

Hi, it's Henry on for Jordan here. Thanks for squeezing me in.

Hi, Andy. Maybe to start with just on the near term outlook for the material handling business. Can you just talk to the improvements you're seeing around kind of customer receptiveness to some of the price increases from the beginning of the year.

Andrew Marsh

Yeah. Always tough to increase prices, and we had to increase prices pretty dramatically. But you will see an uptick in material handling business in the fourth quarter. We review it actually twice a week, and feel real good about that. And we see a growth of 20% to 30% next year, which Jose and others will roll out during the Symposium tomorrow.

I should actually add this. We found during this difficult process that our value proposition was stronger than we knew and has been shared with us by customers. And for many of our customers look up, there really isn't an alternative.

They move goods more rapidly. So bring electricity to buildings. I think everybody knows challenging. The backlog on the grid 3.5 years. The resiliency of our value proposition, material handling.

After a tough year we got rid of PPAs. We got our revenue probably would have been $100 million higher this year if we would have kept the PPAs in place. But the value proposition is much, much stronger, quite honestly than we thought.

Thanks, that's helpful. I mean, just looking at the path the gross margin positive here. And maybe this is more of a question for next year. But other business lines you all have looked at or could look at to divest of in the future to kind of further improve cash flow, and the margin profile here.

Andrew Marsh

We're always looking at the businesses, and we've sat down and we've looked at the value and we don't see when you look at the whole spectrum and Sanjay, myself, and Paul, spent a lot of time on this over the months. And so the answer to your question directly is no to that.

Good morning. My DoE conditional loan, and hey, good morning, actually at the airport coming to your Symposium. But my DoE conditional loan and 45 production tax credit questions were the answer. But I wanted to ask based on the election outcome last week, when would you maybe start marketing or targeting oil and gas customers?

Andrew Marsh

Well, you're looking at our electrolyzer business, I think our biggest customers are oil and gas customers. We already are. So, I mean, (inaudible) Iberdola, bp, Mole, they're all oil and gas companies and probably a good deal that 8 gigawatts in backlog is oil and gas.

And hydrogen derivatives. So that's our -- so there has been a big, big focus. And I think you touched on a point that the market for hydrogen and green hydrogen today is really, and this is a positive, you don't have to change your whole way of doing business.

It's really a substitution of gray hydrogen versus green hydrogen. And in Europe, there's a goal of 42% green hydrogen by to replace gray hydrogen by 2030. Whether it happens by 2030 or 2033, that's really the push.

Tim Moore

Understandable. Yeah, I was just wondering if you're going to target them more, because we keep reading about their appetite for blue hydrogen. I'm just wondering if you're really going to step it up and try to substitute a blue hydrogen wave.

Good. Now, and the other question I had was on your BEDP of the 3 gigawatts with Australia, the alloy green ammonia. You put out that nice press release last month about the binding framework agreement that talked about late 2026 or early 2027 for system delivery.

Do you think there'd be a sizable amount of revenue recognition that could flow through your income statement in the first half of 2026, given that it's complicated design package deal with milestones.

Andrew Marsh

I'll let Sanjay take that one, and see where this is part of what he does every day.

Sanjay Shrestha

So first half, 2026, probably not a big revenue opportunity. It's probably second half '26 and '27. So given the size of the project and the scale of the project, there's a decent amount of work that we both going to have to do, right. So given where we are today, it's probably more second half rather than first half of that year.

Tim Moore

Great, thanks. And I'll see you tomorrow at the Symposium.

Thanks for taking the question. Good morning Andy, thanks for taking the question. I have a higher level and maybe more longer term strategy question here. And it's just kind of -- it's around the thoughts around some of these new market like stationary power, on-road vehicles.

Obviously, it's been somewhat of a challenge to scale those businesses. The unit economics of green hydrogen is kind of ebb and flowed, depending on prices of renewable electricity, which obviously has drifted higher here over the last two years.

I'm just wondering is there a scenario where you would be okay, just kind of going back to your roots, and providing the material handling units, and maybe meaningfully reducing your exposure to some of these newer fuel cell markets. Just in order to kind of get your business and your company back to a point of financial strength.

Andrew Marsh

I think Andrew, you're missing the huge in that question, the huge opportunity outside the United States, the substitute green hydrogen for gray hydrogen today, as well as derivatives like ammonia and methanol that Sanjay mentioned.

That market in electrolyzers just take a look at we did $56 million in the third quarter. It's going to be higher in the fourth quarter. And that to me is a huge market opportunity. When it comes to the hydrogen plants, nothing works if we become dependent on two companies to provide hydrogen.

You're already seeing the value of the hydrogen plant in the financials as the gross margins improve. That's we need those plants to make material handling and stationary ultimately work. So I know that may sound interesting, but when you get down to where the markets are growing, and the fact that electrolyzers and hydrogen for bigger markets and material handling today, and you look at the margin improvements in hydrogen, and just going to continue to improve, that's not a path we're going down.

Andrew Percoco

Understood. And maybe if you could just elaborate on what global markets, you do see the most attractive unit economics for electrolyzers and maybe some of your fuel cell technologies. I mean, I think we've seen obviously in the US some challenges, but even in Europe, there's been a number of some fairly high profile green hydrogen projects get canceled or pushed to the right a little bit.

So I'm just kind of curious where that bullish commentary, or thought comes from what global markets are you seeing that, right?

Andrew Marsh

So Sanjay, you want to take it? I think the 8 gigawatts of BEDP is one example.

Sanjay Shrestha

So Andrew again, I think if you just start to even think about our funnel, right? That number will be much larger than that 8 gig, a lot of basic engineering design packets. So some of the project getting potentially canceled, some of the project getting moved to the right, frankly speaking, at the given where the state of this industry is, that's not a surprise.

But the way we're looking at it is who are the customer, have they secured offtake? Are they going to be able to get financial close? Are they going to get to FID, right? And that's the approach we've taken.

So when you really look at our pipeline on the electrolyzer side, right, that 8 gigawatt probably continues to grow, some probably will fall off. But we feel pretty good about it, as I just briefly mentioned earlier, right?

Like 2025, we certainly expect a pretty big booking here for that electrolyzer business, and that mix is going to be Europe and more likely Australia, that's the mix at this point in time.

Andrew Marsh

Yeah. I know one customer told us yesterday, Sanjay, that we've been under selling our capabilities when it comes to electrolyzers and hydrogen plants. I mean, it was a large global player.

I have another large global player that's in our Rochester facility today. So if anything, we probably, we probably I think when folks see Georgia, see Rochester, see our integrators in Vietnam and Dubai in Europe. I think they step back and say who else has the infrastructure and capabilities to support this market growth?

Andrew Percoco

Understood. I'll take the rest of it offline. Thank you guys.

Hey, good morning, all. And thank you for taking my question. I just have one. I want to be mindful of the time here. I had a question about the fuel cell ITC. It expires at the end of this year. And I was wondering if you expect your fuel cell products to qualify for the tech neutral ITC or PTC. And if not, just how are you approaching the expiration of ITC in your pricing discussions with customers for 2025? Thank you.

Andrew Marsh

Yeah, good question. And we're probably the only fuel cell company that can really leverage tech neutral. So it's challenging because the regulations are mishmash at the moment. But because we have our green hydrogen platform, it puts us in a much better position than any other fuel cell company. So it's almost like going back to the last question.

Yeah, our hydrogen plants and green hydrogen plants are really important. That being said, we are working and have been working. Now, we think it's good for the entire fuel cell industry for the ITC to continue, and that there is work that I know there's over 18 republicans who have signed up, many of them who sit on house ways and means to extend the ITC much like they did in 2018 under President Trump before.

So an important, yes, but we're probably in the only company that in the fuel cell industry that because of what we've done with plants have worked around.

I don't know about the last part. But a quick -- two quick ones. Just wanted to follow-up on the convert real quick. So the buyer of the convert, they do have the ability to convert into common shares, I guess monthly, is that correct? And what are the conditions that they have to have to kind of convert on a monthly basis?

Yeah. So they have the option if they like over the term to amortize a portion, it's a limited amount per month if they do elect that option. We have the option to pay them back in cash. If we choose to, we can provide shares, it's not automatic that they get shares.

So they have a long view of Plug, and where the stock will go, and then they're certainly with the no short position a clause that reasserts that. We think this will continue to show progress with the gross margin and the growth of the company.

And but they would like that amortization capability as to the duration alone. So it's not a foregone conclusion. They will ask for that, but they have that optionality.

Operator

Thank you. We reach end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.

Andrew Marsh

So, thank you for taking the time today, and I look forward to seeing many folks either online or in person to Plug Symposium tomorrow. So thank you everyone. Bye now.

Operator

Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

logistics delay,When AI meets cloud ERP: Driving the digital shift in India's automotive manufacturing,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/when-ai-meets-cloud-erp-driving-the-digital-shift-in-indias-automotive-manufacturing/articleshow/115923886.cms,"From ""minimal"" integration of Information Technology (IT) only a decade ago to leveraging technology-Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular-becoming an absolute necessity, the Indian automotive manufacturing sector is embracing change and transforming towards becoming a global force to reckon with.

""I was pretty dismayed by the IT being deployed in this industry. It was minimal a decade back,"" said Vinnie Mehta, General Secretary of the Automotive Components Manufacturing Association of India (ACMA). ""Then came the pandemic, and the entire industry transformed itself, and that was something wonderful to have happened,"" Mehta added.

Mehta said that everyone jumped onto the IT bandwagon in the industry almost overnight, to the point that ERP systems have now become integral to managing the entire value chain.

""It is only fitting, given the fact that the whole automotive value chain contributes to around 7% of India's GDP, and the auto component industry is half of that. Today, it is hard to envisage a manufacturing value chain without the ERP systems,"" he said.

Mehta was joined by Aiyappa Muthanna, Senior Solutions Engineer Epicor; Sanjay Narang, General Manager, Minda Industries Limited; and Vijayakumar P, General Manager, Manufacturing Excellence, Sundaram Auto-Components Limited for a panel discussion, titled 'AI, Cloud ERP and the Road Ahead: Optimising Indian Automotive Manufacturing for the Digital Age'. Moderated by Neha Dewan, this webinar was hosted by Epicor and powered by The Economic Times.

These industry leaders decoded how cloud ERP systems and integrated AI are reshaping Indian automotive manufacturing in terms of real-time decision-making, resource efficiency, sustainability, achieving competitive advantage, business continuity, predictive maintenance, and more.

A cornerstone in decision-making

Providing real-time visibility and enabling swift and informed decision-making to manage and mitigate supply chain disruptions has always been a challenge for any industry, and the manufacturing industry has been no exception.

The ERP systems, however, have been pivotal in transforming the supply chain, integrating data across procurement and material logistics to a unified platform.

""We are able to see real-time bottlenecks, which enables us to predict the potential failures,"" Narang said, adding, ""For instance, we can provide real-time updates to our suppliers by using tools like advanced shipping notes and schedules.""

Elaborating further, Narang said that this enables them to quickly identify underperforming suppliers or those not meeting production capacities, allowing his company to pinpoint potential problem areas.

""With all this information, we can take proactive measures, including relocating quotas to other suppliers, and ensure seamless operations across supply chains,"" Narang of Minda Industries Limited said.

Mehta added that there was a pile of data which, when tied together, gives one a huge amount of visibility. ""This visibility can help bring in a lot of efficiency in our automotive value chains, where we pride ourselves in just-in-time processes. This is not possible without the ERP systems tying all the data together,"" he said.

He explained that ERP solutions provide both upstream and downstream visibility so that the value chain can operate seamlessly. ""The industry continues to use it very effectively. We are probably a shining example of the manufacturing industry in India, and also globally. We are a globally competitive industry,"" he explained.

Predictive maintenance and equipment optimisation

Predictive maintenance is often seen as a game-changer in manufacturing. ERP is enabling this kind of maintenance while leveraging data analytics, and anticipating equipment failure.

""The AI tools integrated with the ERP solutions enable us to take realistic action,"" Narang said. ""Advanced tools, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors on the machines, can give you a sense of the kind of maintenance, and types of equipment required at the right time. It enables us to take appropriate calls,"" Narang elucidated.

The impact, Narang said, has been phenomenal with an increase in the reliability of machinery, and prevention of unplanned breakdowns in the industry. ""This is how the IoT collaboration with the ERP is giving us very strong and impressive results. 40% of uptime and 30% of activity asset life has been improved,"" Narang added.

Muthanna, seconding Narang on the subject, said that this was giving organisations greater equipment efficiency, production solutions, and reliability to the systems, through the deployment of IoT-based sensors onto the machinery.

He said that early warning signals provide real-time analysis and enable realistic actions, which goes a long way toward maintaining productivity and keeping machine equipment in the finest order. ""It has been no less than a revolution in the manufacturing sector,"" Muthanna stressed.

Efficacy, visibility, acceleration, and customisation

Muthanna highlighted how ERP solutions enable adaptive manufacturing, by mapping finite capacity resources, including machines and tools, and scheduling them based on demand types.

This becomes important given that customisations are critical in scenarios like engineering-to-order or configure-to-order, and modern ERP systems can provide visual configurators to allow customers to design their products from scratch.

""Beyond that, the ERP systems can automate key engineering processes,"" Muthanna said, adding, ""For instance, once a design is finalised, they can seamlessly generate and automate design-to-manufacturing Bill of Materials (BOMs), as well as routings.""

He asserted that this system eliminates manual intervention, reduces errors, and shortens the timeline from design to manufacturing. In the process, efficiency is enhanced, and time to market accelerates, which tends to be a pivot in today's competitive market.

The panellists highlighted one of the most frequently encountered challenges by the automotive manufacturing industry -- last-minute changes during production, which can cause factors such as the unavailability of materials or components, which can cause significant disruptions.

""ERP systems come to the rescue,"" argued Muthanna. ""By providing real-time solutions. They can suggest alternate materials, or suppliers capable of rapid shipments,"" he added.

Supply chain disruptions are a common issue faced in the automotive manufacturing sector.

ERP systems, Muthanna said, can enable seamless actions in times of disruptions, including material shortage and/or logistics delay by highlighting impacted areas, suggesting alternative sourcing options, and providing updated delivery timelines. ""This capability ensures minimal downtime and helps organisations maintain business continuity, even during challenging situations,"" Muthanna explained.

Managing the inventory

A greater visibility and control over inventory is imperative for efficient manufacturing and supply processes, in any industry, more so in the automotive manufacturing industry.

Vijayakumar argued that by implementing barcodes and an ERP-integrated tracking system, inventory becomes more visible and manageable that too across all stages.

""This is important in reducing inefficiencies and enabling better decision-making,"" he said. ""We map all our inventories through an inventory tree, and we can find out the inventory in various locations, right from raw material and beyond,"" Vijayakumar added.

He said that through better synchronisation, the inventory turnover ratio can be improved significantly. He gave the example of his own company where the current inventory turnover has improved to 23-24 from 15 to 16, and the company is expecting to take it to 30.

The sustainability driver

Sustainability is at the heart of every venture, in the times we are living in. Managing hazardous waste, and aligning operations with carbon neutrality initiatives has become central to manufacturing.

The panellists at the webinar said that ERP systems and integrated AI facilitate meeting sustainable manufacturing goals, with features such as emission tracking and resource efficiency monitoring.

""Emission tracking and resource efficiency monitoring, with the help of IoT and ERP dashboards, helps us reduce wastage and meet sustainability goals while adhering to government norms,"" Muthanna said.

Mehta added that the ERP systems track resource usage, including electricity, water, raw materials, emissions, and waste, helping companies to meet sustainability goals.

""And that too while meeting the regulatory requirements,"" Mehta said, adding, ""When you have data, and you put analytics to it, you can manage things much better, ERP solutions help track resource efficiency, emissions, and waste, contributing significantly to sustainability.""

The future

The panellists felt that the automotive industry was on the right track, vis-à-vis integration of ERP systems and IoT, enhancing factory operations, logistics, and predictive analytics for greater competitiveness.

""Now we need to put something on top of it, and that is artificial intelligence,"" Mathur said.

Muthanna said that Epicor was building an AI-infused cognitive ERP to provide real-time insights and support decision-making through advanced analytics, and conversational User Interfaces (UIs).

Going forward, however, the solutions need to be cost-effective, and people should be able to talk about these solutions in their language so that there is a seamless integration of these systems in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, AI, Narang"

shipping routes,The Shipping Industry Can Help Carbon Capture Sail Ahead,Hellenic Shipping News,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/the-shipping-industry-can-help-carbon-capture-sail-ahead/,"Where sequestration opportunities close to emitters are limited, cross-border shipping of CO2 can play a key part in the CCUS value chain and help mitigate climate change, according to Opportunities for Shipping to Enable Cross-Border CCUS Initiatives, a new report by BCG and the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD). Shipping CO2 will be especially important in Asia-Pacific (APAC) due to the region's geography, with vast oceans and seas between emitters and sequestration sites.

We estimate that around 170 MtPA of CO2 captured using CCUS technology will be transported globally via shipping by 2050, with a significant volume operating within APAC. This will require 100 to 200 vessels, costing up to $30 billion. Creating a market of this size will necessitate actions from both the public and the private sectors. These include economic support measures, long-term contracts for midstream players, greater clarity on key standards, as well as an overarching regulatory framework that establishes sector rules and regulations, such as for the cross-border movement of CO2.

Three Key Insights

Through our collaboration, three important insights have emerged relating to the role of shipping in unlocking the potential of cross-border CCUS, the importance of technical specifications and standards as enablers, and the regulatory hurdles that threaten to hold back its development. While the insights are globally applicable, the report specifically highlights opportunities for shipping that support APAC governments' ambition to decarbonize their economies. We see the broadest demand and need for shipping in this region.

The Role of Shipping

Shipping is a viable solution for transporting captured CO2 across borders because it is more cost-effective than pipelines over longer distances (particularly across more than 500 kilometers and below an annual volume of 5 MtPA). Given the cost advantage, maritime transportation of CO2 is expected to emerge as part of the CCUS value chain in APAC and Europe, especially where some clusters of emitters do not have local access to CO2 sequestration sites. (See Exhibit 1.) Norway's Northern Lights cross-border project, for example, will include the shipping of captured CO2 from industrial sources to an onshore terminal on the country's west coast, with the first injection into a geological formation in the North Sea expected in 2025. In APAC, shipping can help countries achieve ambitious decarbonization targets by connecting regions with substantial CO2 emission volumes, such as Northeast Asia, to regions with available sequestration capacity, such as Australia and Southeast Asia.

Several APAC governments, including Australia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, are pursuing partnerships and initiatives to facilitate cross-border CO2 transportation and sequestration. On the basis of these agreements, we have identified multiple routes that could emerge by 2030.

We estimate that the total volume of captured CO2 transported by sea across borders within APAC could reach about 100 MtPA by 2050. Shipping this volume of liquefied CO2 would require 85 to 150 vessels, costing from $10 billion to $25 billion.

The Importance of Technical Specifications and Standards

To be shipped, CO2 must be liquefied and kept under pressure. Today, CO2 is shipped mainly for food and beverage applications and is usually conveyed under medium-pressure conditions.3 But there is growing interest in transporting captured CO2 under low- and elevated-pressure conditions. Each of these conditions requires specific types of vessels and tank storage infrastructure, and each has advantages and risks.

Getting the technical aspects right is essential for seamless cross-border CCUS project development. Consequently, greater coordination and alignment on specifications governing infrastructure and the conditions under which CO2 can be transported will be required. The private sector can lead the efforts to achieve effective standards, with governments playing a role in formalizing and endorsing standards once companies reach a general agreement.

The Impact of Economic and Regulatory Gaps

We have identified several gaps in financial support mechanisms and regulations that need to be addressed if cross-border CCUS is to flourish.

Economic Gaps. The investment required to scale up cross-border CCUS is substantial. The end-to-end levelized cost4 of cross-border CCUS with shipping (covering capture to permanent sequestration) ranges from $141 to $174 per ton of CO2 for routes within Southeast Asia to $167 to $287 per ton of CO2 for routes between Northeast Asia and Australia.

Capture and shipping costs account for 60% to 80% of the estimated total expenses of cross-border CCUS routes. Longer shipping routes, such as from Northeast Asia to Australia, tend to have higher average levelized costs owing to greater shipping costs. Moreover, CO2 shipping routes within APAC involve emitters with low CO2 concentration streams -- including cement, chemical, and iron and steel plants -- resulting in increased capture costs compared with emitters that have high concentration streams.

Because of these expenses, a significant gap exists for potential CO2 exporters between levelized cross-border CCUS costs and domestic carbon pricing. In APAC countries, carbon taxes and emissions-trading-system prices are $2 to $18 per ton of CO2, which is far below the range of levelized CCUS costs within the region. Without additional financial support, the challenging economics of cross-border CCUS could impede its development.

Regulatory Gaps. Nascent regulations in several areas threaten to hinder the development of cross-border CCUS in the region. In countries across APAC, domestic regulations need to be established to govern carbon accounting and verification methodologies for CCUS, establish permitting procedures for cross-border CCUS projects, and define players' liabilities. In addition, bilateral and multilateral frameworks are required to clarify the jurisdictional authority responsible for cross-border projects and provide certainty on the allocation of liabilities (such as commercial and operational liabilities for CO2 leaks). Establishing these regulations and frameworks can provide greater certainty to project developers -- mitigating policy risk concerns and supporting CCUS projects and offtake agreements.

Three Components to Actuate Cross-Border CCUS via Shipping

Governments and private sector players need to provide three essential elements to activate the shipping industry for cross-border CCUS.

Direct Economic Support

Governments can extend economic assistance to midstream players, such as shipping and port providers, using financial incentives, support packages that can underwrite cross-value-chain risks, and other forms of business model support. Such measures can help to reduce upfront capital expenditures and overall project costs for companies, which is particularly important for cross-border CCUS and shipping to take off.

Long-Term Contracts and Minimum Volume Guarantees

Emitters will need to provide long-term contracts to shipping and terminal providers -- ideally agreements of ten years or more -- and commit to transporting a minimum volume of CO2 to give these value chain participants greater certainty and allow them to plan ahead. (Together with owners and operators of sequestration capacity, emitters are expected to orchestrate the cross-border CCUS value chain by providing long-term contracts, owning key cargo [CO2] and infrastructure, and leading consultations with governments.) Such commitments also enable shipping and terminal players to obtain the necessary financing for investing in vessels and capacity.

Clarity on Standards and Specifications for Shipping

For the sector to expand, shipping providers need clarity from regulators and leading companies on the standards governing technical matters such as permissible impurities in CO2 cargo, operating pressures, and temperatures along the value chain. Early alignment on specifications will enable midstream players, such as shipping and terminal providers, to put in place interoperable infrastructure.

Developments in the upstream (carbon capture) and downstream (sequestration) parts of the CCUS value chain will inevitably have a major impact on midstream players, and vice versa, owing to interdependencies along the value chain. Providing financial incentives and regulatory certainty to upstream and downstream companies can help to stimulate investment certainty for the midstream. Consequently, regulators and the private sector will need to monitor linkages between the different parts of the value chain to ensure that they are aligned.

The success of CCUS hinges on the development of all elements of the value chain -- including midstream activities, such as shipping and intermediate storage -- simultaneously. By working together and overcoming the obstacles outlined in this report, both public and private stakeholders can successfully develop the CCUS value chain in its entirety, unlocking the valuable decarbonization opportunities that carbon capture can offer.

The terminal is expected to significantly increase container train volumes along the China-Europe-China route via the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR, also known as the Middle Corridor). It will reduce transportation costs and streamline cargo handling times.

The project is both timely and overdue, given the rapidly growing freight traffic along the TITR. On December 3, the 300th container block train from China to Azerbaijan via Kazakhstan was dispatched along this route. According to Azerbaijan Railways CJSC, the volume of cargo transported along the TITR from China has exceeded 27,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers this year, a 25-fold increase compared to the same period last year.

This growth highlights the rising interest of shippers in the Middle Corridor as a vital route connecting China to Europe through Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. It also underscores the urgent need to expand existing port infrastructure and build new facilities capable of handling increasing cargo volumes.

Plans for 2025-2026 include tripling the number of block trains from China to Europe, with a goal of reaching 1,000 trains by 2027. Furthermore, freight shipments in the opposite direction have begun; on November 24, the first export block train from Baku to Xi'an, consisting of 62 forty-foot containers, was dispatched. By year's end, 600 containers carrying 15,000 tonnes of export cargo are expected to be shipped.

Terminal project

The agreement to establish the new intermodal cargo terminal was signed on November 12, during the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in Baku.

The agreement was signed by director general of Baku Port Taleh Ziyadov, chairman of the board of Kazakhstan Railways (KTZ) Nurlan Sauranbayev and Yuan Xiaojun, director general of Xi'an Free Trade Port Construction and Operation Co., Ltd. The ceremony was attended by Ruslan Alikhanov, director general of Azerbaijan Investment Holding, and Nurlan Zhakuov, chairman of the board of Samruk-Kazyna.

The terminal will become key infrastructure for handling various types of cargo using multimodal transport, including sea, rail and road. Initially planned to cover an area of 40 hectares, the project includes the construction of a universal cargo yard, a covered warehouse spanning 5,000 square metres, and a container yard with a capacity of over 1,000 containers. The terminal will adhere to modern logistics standards, emphasising digital technologies and process standardisation.

Goals in alignment

The terminal project is not only relevant to Azerbaijan and China but also crucial for Kazakhstan. As noted by Kazakh media, the establishment of a new hub in Azerbaijan aligns with Kazakhstan's Railway Transport Development Concept, which includes the development of the TITR as a key component. The concept, adopted in mid-2024, outlines plans to build a network of cargo terminals and container hubs within Kazakhstan and abroad.

The project involves the Kazakhstan-Azerbaijan SK-AIH Investment Fund, Kazakhstan Railways, Baku International Sea Trade Port and Xi'an Free Trade Port Construction and Operation. The ownership structure reflects a commitment to equitable cooperation, with SK-AIH Investment Fund holding a 10% stake, and the other three participants each holding 30%.

While exact project timelines and costs remain undisclosed, the stakeholders aim to complete the terminal promptly, given the critical need for its capacities to support efficient freight operations. The infrastructure being developed in Alat will mark a significant step in the Middle Corridor's evolution, strengthening economic cooperation between Azerbaijan, China, and Kazakhstan.

Trade artery

The Baku International Sea Trade Port is the largest port on the Caspian Sea. Speaking at COP29, Ziyadov highlighted that the port is entering the second phase of construction, focused on creating infrastructure for container transportation. The first phase enabled a throughput capacity of 15mn tonnes, while the second phase aims to increase this capacity to 25mn tonnes, primarily emphasising container freight.

Ziyadov underscored the importance of the new intermodal cargo terminal in this context. ""Cargo from China and Kazakhstan to Europe will pass through our port and be delivered to their destinations via rail and road through the new terminal. The terminal will also offer storage facilities. Kazakhstan's export potential through our port is approximately 4mn tonnes. Cargo volumes from China to Europe are expected to grow from 100,000 to 300,000 containers,"" he said.

The terminal is poised to become a pivotal part of the Middle Corridor, addressing the increasing demand for efficient cargo transportation between China, Central Asia and Europe. Its advanced infrastructure and multimodal capabilities will streamline trade routes, reduce transit times and optimise costs, making it an attractive option for global logistics companies.

Construction of the terminal will not only enhance the Middle Corridor's capacity but also foster stronger economic ties among its participants.

The collaboration between Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and China in setting up the terminal highlights the strategic importance of the Middle Corridor as an alternative to traditional shipping routes. For Azerbaijan, the terminal will solidify its position as a vital logistics hub in the Caspian region, while Kazakhstan will gain a significant boost in its role as a key transit country connecting Asia and Europe. For China, the development of such infrastructure ensures reliable and diversified trade routes for its goods heading westward.

Furthermore, the terminal's integration into the broader Eurasian logistics network will foster economic development not only for the participating countries but also for neighbouring regions. By facilitating the movement of goods with greater efficiency, the project will attract new investments, strengthen interregional ties, and contribute to the sustainable growth of the Middle Corridor as a critical artery for global trade.",,,"600 containers, 000 containers, 000 containers",N/A,N/A,"Azerbaijan, Alat, Kazakhstan, Baku, China, Xi'an, KTZ"

One year ago, tension erupted in the Red Sea when Houthi rebels started attacking global shipping. Since then, Houthis have targeted over 90 commercial vessels, damaging over 30 ships and sinking two. Attacks continue in the area, with the most recent drones attempting to attack a U.S. warship. What's more, supply chains are still recovering from the disruption.

While container vessels are the most affected, they are not the only ones rerouting to avoid the Red Sea, according to a recap provided by project44.

""The ongoing Houthi rebel attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea have drastically impacted global shipping routes, particularly through the Suez Canal, leading to significant delays and disruptions. Carriers have been forced to reroute vessels, resulting in increased transit times of up to 47% on key trade lanes, especially those connecting Asia to Europe and the U.S. The rerouting has hit European ports the hardest, while the U.S. East Coast has seen less disruption due to the Panama Canal offering an alternative route. As tensions continue, the safety of frontline seafarers remains paramount, while the global supply chain faces ongoing uncertainty,"" according to project44.",,,,N/A,N/A,U.S.
shipping routes,Peru's new megaport reveals a refined Belt and Road,Lowy Institute for International Policy,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/peru-s-new-megaport-reveals-refined-belt-road,"Chancay megaport in the small town 80 kilometres north of the Peruvian capital Lima, on 29 October 2024 (Cris Bouroncle/AFP via Getty Images)

China should be extremely grateful to the Peruvian government of Dina Boluarte. Courtesy of her Congress, which rewrote the rules of foreign ownership to make it happen after a long dispute with the country's ports authority, China's state-owned Cosco shipping giant has wrapped up exclusive use of Peru's brand-new Chancay deep-water megaport for up to 60 years.

Numerous other benefits come with the deal. For a relatively small investment of about US$1.6 billion - its share of the total $3.6 billion cost - Cosco has a 60 per cent stake. China also gets an important new connection between China and Latin America in the form of two new container shipping routes.

Simultaneously, the logistics costs of China's exports into the region will fall significantly, and the revenues of the operator, Cosco Ports, will increase. There will also be further opportunities for Chinese connections in the region, as President Xi Jinping made a point of mentioning when he officially opened the port in mid-November.

The port is a classic Belt and Road operation that takes more than it gives.

Once again, China's Belt and Road strategy has beaten the United States to the punch. Located 80 kilometres from the capital Lima, the port symbolises America's continuing and costly neglect of Latin America. It says much that Peru, a nation of 38 million, already has a substantially bigger trade with China ($36 billion) than it does with the United States ($21 billion) when it should, of course, be the other way around.

Outgoing President Joe Biden's state visits to Peru and Brazil in November are only his second to South America during his entire term. As the Atlantic Council points out: ""At both stops he will seek to regain US momentum but without much to offer following Democratic Party losses last week."" Donald Trump made just one visit to this region of 33 countries in his last term and that was to Argentina.

Meantime, the port is a classic Belt and Road operation that takes more than it gives. While it promises to boost Peru's exports into the Pacific, deliver $4.5 billion a year in revenues, and create 8,000 jobs, its construction was mired in controversy. Peru's Ojo Público news outlet notes that Cosco and Volcan, a local mining group that shared construction, were able to seize a large maritime area that was supposed to be earmarked for defence, start work without any environmental studies (landslides during construction of a 1.8-kilometre-long tunnel buried homes), and bought up publicly owned land at less than a dollar a square metre. Compensation claims of local protest groups ""were met with indifference and harassment"".

Senior US military are also concerned. Last year, General Laura Richardson of the US Southern Command warned that China is ""on the 20-yard line of our homeland"", citing Chancay's potential to be a dual-use facility, accommodating military vessels. If that were to happen, Cosco Ports would be in the middle.

""If a conflict were to break out in, for example, Taiwan or the South China Sea, this global network of 38 Cosco-operated ports could pose a serious logistical challenge for foreign militaries looking to move ships or supplies to the Indo-Pacific"", warns the Atlantic Council.

And it's now 39 ports. In October, Cosco bought a substantial stake in Thailand's largest container port, Laem Chabang, for US$110 million, according to its website. Extremely profitable according to its latest accounts, Cosco claims a 28 per cent profit on a fast-growing income, about a quarter from its overseas ports. As of late 2024, Cosco was building and/or operating ports in strategic waterways from the Aegean Sea to the Panama Canal.

The problem may be that Western-style capitalism cannot compete with China's state-managed version.

The Atlantic Council believes it's high time Western countries stepped in with their own capital projects in order to ""counter malign Chinese (and Russian) influence in Latin America and the Caribbean"". These should be ""attractive and affordable alternatives for regional economic development"" that would be based on investment in projects that would serve as alternatives to Beijing-backed initiatives. The problem may be that Western-style capitalism cannot compete with China's state-managed version. For instance, no American firm bid for the major expansion of Colombia's Bogota metro, while three Chinese firms did.

Meantime, as the Lowy Institute's latest Pacific Aid Map shows, China is refining its Belt and Road strategy in the Pacific through ""a resurgence in new project commitments [that] signal a revival in Beijing's engagement with the region"". In concrete terms, China is targeting specific countries with big-ticket grants rather than loans while handing out ""high-frequency smaller grants administered through its embassies"". The Solomon Islands' Constituency Development Fund has, for example, banked ""a large-scale direct budget transfer"" from Beijing, while Kiribati's Social Stability Fund is a recipient of a substantial transfer, also courtesy of Beijing. As the Institute explains, each of those loans is ""characterised by weak accountability mechanisms"". (No reference to these grants can be found on either country's official government sites.)

Peru's new port may mark the death knell of another epic project - a gigantic, 125-kilometre-long canal through Nicaragua that would rival the Panama Canal. Originally mooted more than a century ago, it was revived in 2013 by a shadowy Chinese company called HKND that committed to building the canal before 2020. ""World trade has been so developed today that it needs a new canal,"" said its promoter Mr Wang Jing. Progress went as far as a 50-year right issued by the Nicaraguan government, renewable for a further 50 years, but little has been heard since.

Meantime, Peru's new port expands Chinese economic influence deep into the country and beyond. Very much designed for the future, it can handle a million containers, six million tons of bulk cargo and, in a big boost for China's automotive sector, 160,000 vehicles. A 1.8-kilometre-long tunnel leads straight to the Pan-American Highway. Next up will be a regional distribution hub that will essentially warehouse Chinese-made goods destined for South America.

In short, an economic beachhead for China in Latin America to the cost of the United States.",,"billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, million",,N/A,N/A,"Beijing, Kiribati, Brazil, The Solomon Islands', Peru, Colombia, China, America, Taiwan, Thailand, US, Argentina, Bogota, Lima, the United States, Nicaragua"

shipping routes,Houthis causing negligible damage to Israeli trade - study,Globes,https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-houthis-causing-negligible-damage-to-israel-trade---study-1001496660,"Bank of Israel research found that the blockade of the Bab al Mandab strait has done minimal damage to international trade and has hardly affected Israel.

Despite many concerns about cargo bottlenecks as hasppened in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the blockade of the Bab al-Mandab Strait by the Houthis in western Yemen has not caused any great damage, according to a new Bank of Israel study by Haggayi Etkes and Nitzan Feldman of the School of Political Science at the University of Haifa.

Shipping prices have risen, but these increases have moderated dramatically in the past six months due to the impressive flexibility of the global system and effective resource diversion by shipping companies. In addition, the impact on Israel is marginal to non-existent - due to Israel's intensive trade with Europe, which is not affected by the blockade of the straits, and early preventive actions, which has softened the blow over time.

Following the Outbreak of the war in October 2023, the Houthi rebels, supported by Iran, joined the attacks on Israel. As well as firing ballistic missiles at Israel, they also blocked most of the shipping passing through the Bab al Mandab strait. The strait provides the only passage to the Suez Canal linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean and saving the long journey around Africa. Due to the recent experience of the severe international trade bottleneck following the Covid pandemic, which increased transportation prices tenfold, there were concerns about a new trade backlog that would increase the cost of living and hinder economic growth, as actually happened after the closure of the Suez Canal in the 1960s and 1970s.

Trade was diverted to alternative routes

However, despite an almost six-fold jump in shipping prices on the Shanghai-Genoa route, which normally passes through the Bab el-Mandab Strait, prices have fallen significantly in the past six months to ""only"" double prices on the eve of the war. Because shipping costs are only a small part of the price of goods, this means that the impact on the cost of living is relatively negligible. Trade has been diverted to alternative routes, mainly circumnavigating Africa's Cape of Good Hope, and although the route takes longer and consumes more fuel, it has been a sufficient alternative to minimize the effects. Although diverting resources from other shipping routes (for example, in the Pacific Ocean) increased prices on these routes, they also helped mitigate the damage from blocking the straits.

In contrast to the situation in the 1960s and 1970s, the study's authors write, ""The processes of globalization and the continuous improvements in maritime transport in recent decades - including the reduction of regulation of the maritime transport market, the expansion of the use of containers and the digitization of transport information - make it easier for shipping companies to respond more flexibly to changes in transport markets."" In other words, market mechanisms seem to be proving themselves, dramatically moderating the influence that the Houthis tried to create in order to pressure the world to stop Israel's war in Gaza.

Israel, which is in fact the Houthis' main target, has hardly been affected. The study presents it as ""a notable exception: the value of Israeli imports from Asia-Oceania, which is usually transported via the Red Sea, fell even before the Houthi attacks at a rate similar to the decline in the value of imports from the rest of the world. Import prices to Israel have also remained stable and appear to have been unaffected by the rerouting of shipping.

The reasons for this, according to the study, are that Israel's trade routes with Asia are small compared to most Western countries to begin with, and the volume of imports in general has decreased due to the effects of the war. In addition, ""Israeli shipping company ZIM, whose home port is in the city of Haifa, was quick to reroute its vessels to alternative shipping routes around Africa, as early as November 2023, before other shipping companies did so, in December 2023, which caused the decline in imports to Israel to be more gradual compared to the decline recorded in other countries.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Bab el-Mandab Strait, Gaza, Haifa, Shanghai, Yemen, Israel, Iran"
shipping routes,How Starmer's Chagos deal could play into China's hands,Yahoo,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/starmer-chagos-deal-could-play-164900227.html,"Agalega, which comprises two tiny islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean, 500 miles or so northeast of Madagascar, is an idyllic-looking spot. White sands, turquoise waters, palm trees. Paradise.

Or it used to be. In 2015, however, Mauritius, which owns Agalega, signed a deal with India enabling the construction of an Indian base there. Zoom in on Google Maps and a vast development is visible on the larger northern island, complete with a 3000m runway, a jetty and two 60m-wide hangars.

The Indian government has been coy about the purpose of the facility. Experts believe it could serve as a vital strategic outpost for India - a major strategic partner for Mauritius - and a base from which it can keep a watchful eye on the Indian Ocean.

""India's long-term strategy is to be the leading power in the Indian Ocean,"" says Dr David Brewster, a senior research fellow at the National Security College, of the Australian National University, who specialises in maritime security in the Indian Ocean. ""[Agalega] is an extended airfield that will be used for maritime aerial surveillance by Indian aircraft and naval aircraft in the south-west Indian ocean.""

Locals fear the island's experience will echo that of Diego Garcia, in the Chagos Islands, 2000km to the east, where the local population was evicted in the late 1960s and early 1970s to make room for a British-American military base. Many of Agalega's current tiny population, of around 300, have family members who were evicted from Diego Garcia during that period. ""It will become a restricted area completely for Indians,"" Laval Soopramanien, president of the Association of Friends of Agalega, recently told the BBC, adding that ""Agalega will become the story of the Chagos Islands.""

Others worry, however, that Agalega might be a model that China could follow as it seeks to expand its influence in the region. Under the terms of Sir Keir Starmer's proposed deal, which has yet to be ratified by the British and Mauritian governments, the Chagos Islands would return to Mauritian sovereignty, but with a minimum 99-year lease granted to guarantee the base on Diego Garcia. The handover has raised the possibility of China doing a similar deal to the one India has done on Agalega and establishing a base in the area, too.

Sir Michael Ellis, a former MP who served as Attorney General for Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, is among those who fear the Chagos deal would encourage a greater Chinese presence in the area. Under the terms of the reported deal, he says, there is a ""real risk"" the Chinese agree with Mauritius to lease one of the other islands and build their own base in close proximity to Diego Garcia, where American bomber aircraft and warships are stationed.

""Furthermore, if the Labour Government gives away sovereignty over the islands,"" he adds, ""the Chinese could get permission from Mauritius to send 'fishing vessels' - which are surveillance vessels - into the waters around Diego Garcia thereby compromising the use of the base.""

Tom Tugendhat, the Tory MP and former shadow security minister, has also expressed fears that Starmer's deal risks ""opening the possibility of China gaining a military foothold in the Indian Ocean.""

""Mauritius is free to rent them out to anybody else,"" he told the BBC when the deal was announced, ""including, for example, China.""

While most experts agree that Diego Garcia is the best natural spot for a base in the region, China has shown geography need not impede its geopolitical aspirations. In the contested waters of the South China Sea, China has militarised at least three artificial islands it has built in the Spratly Islands, arming them with anti-air and ship missiles, fighter planes and jamming equipment, despite President Xi Jinping's previous assurances that they would not be put to such a purpose. The Spratlys occupy a strategic position between Malaysia, the Phillipines and Vietnam, one of the world's most important shipping routes. In the event of any Chinese attack on Taiwan, these armed islands could play a vital role as a staging post and in denying the surrounding area to enemy forces.

""China has shown a willingness to put large resources into making otherwise challenging islands usable for their own military purposes,"" says Ellis. ""There is a real risk they could enter into an agreement with Mauritius to do that with part of the [Chagos] archipelago.""

Beijing has steadily increased its influence in the region in recent years. Mauritius' Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport, which was completed in 2013, was built by Chinese contractors using a £197m Chinese loan. It is only one of several large infrastructure projects built with Beijing's help.

Although President Joe Biden supported the Chagos deal, which cements Diego Garcia's status as a base under international law, members of the incoming Trump administration have expressed reservations. Marco Rubio, incoming President Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has said Starmer's agreement presents a ""serious threat"" to US Security. Senator James Risch, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a backer of Donald Trump, said the proposed deal ""gives in to Chinese lawfare [manipulating international law for strategic ends] and yields to pressure from unaccountable international institutions like the International Court of Justice at the expense of US and UK strategic and military interests.""

Experts say that any possible Chinese benefit is not likely to be immediate. ""While I think this does present a strategic opportunity for Beijing, this is in the long term,"" says William Matthews, Senior Research Fellow for China and the World at Chatham House. ""What it immediately signals is a reduced commitment on the part of the UK to its traditional security presence in the region. However, from China's perspective it is the US presence which is of far greater importance as a strategic threat. A shift from the base being permanent as a possession of a close US ally (the UK) to a temporary, if long-term, lease from Mauritius does signal a shift away from the established security order in the region.

""[But] I do not think it likely that we will see a Chinese base in the Chagos Islands any time soon,"" he adds. ""While China does have a growing economic relationship with Mauritius, this is equally or more true of many other countries around the world, including in the Indian Ocean. A close trade relationship, infrastructure investment, and provision of digital infrastructure, as we see in China's relationship with Mauritius, do not automatically transfer into a partner country granting basing rights. India has closer security relations with Mauritius than China and has had a security presence in the Indian Ocean for longer.""

Tony Blair's former advisor, Jonathan Powell, who is Starmer's special envoy in Mauritius negotiations, was more forthright. ""When you come to see the detailed treaty,"" he told the i, ""you'll see that this idea of a Chinese base is just hooey. It can't happen, won't happen.""

Whatever China's long-term aspirations for the region, India has a considerable headstart. Although it might be a model for a Chinese base, India's Agalega deal also proves they are ahead. ""I don't see there's any reason to think that China could set up a facility in the Chagos, for a whole bunch of reasons,"" says Dr Brewster. ""In terms of security and defence, Mauritius is essentially a client of India. The Mauritius National Security Adviser is a senior officer in [the] Indian intelligence [service] and has been for the last 40 years. The Mauritian coastguard's most senior officer is an Indian naval officer. Seventy per cent of the Mauritian population are of Indian origin. It's more or less an Indian client state.""

He adds that India will welcome any deal which guarantees a strong US presence in the Indian Ocean.

""I haven't seen details of the [Chagos] agreement, but I think there is a high chance that it will include an effective veto over any other military facilities in the archipelago,"" he says. ""India needs the United States in the Indian ocean, because otherwise there would be an effective power vacuum in which the Chinese would enter. The implicit understanding of the United States is that India will eventually take over responsibilities in the Indian Ocean. But 99 years [of the lease] is about as long as it gets in international affairs. It's a statement that the United States is there to stay as long as it wishes to be. It will exclude China from having a role in the Chagos. It's a good news story.""

Barring a sharp change in plan, the UK will soon hand the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius in exchange for the guaranteed lease on Diego Garcia. The US and India, between them, will provide a bulwark against Chinese expansion. Whatever happens, it seems certain that the great powers will continue to use these tiny islands as chess pieces, regardless of what it means for those who live there. The Chagossians of Diego Garcia were not the first islanders to suffer for the whims of geopolitics; the Agalegans will not be the last.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Malaysia, Beijing, UK, hooey, Taiwan, US, Madagascar, the United States, Spratlys, China, the Chagos Islands, Vietnam"

""While China does have a growing economic relationship with Mauritius, this is equally or more true of many other countries around the world, including in the Indian Ocean. A close trade relationship, infrastructure investment, and provision of digital infrastructure, as we see in China's relationship with Mauritius, do not automatically transfer into a partner country granting basing rights. India has closer security relations with Mauritius than China and has had a security presence in the Indian Ocean for longer.""

Tony Blair's former advisor, Jonathan Powell, who is Starmer's special envoy in Mauritius negotiations, was more forthright. ""When you come to see the detailed treaty,"" he told the i, ""you'll see that this idea of a Chinese base is just hooey. It can't happen, won't happen.""

Whatever China's long-term aspirations for the region, India has a considerable headstart. Although it might be a model for a Chinese base, India's Agalega deal also proves they are ahead. ""I don't see there's any reason to think that China could set up a facility in the Chagos, for a whole bunch of reasons,"" says Dr Brewster. ""In terms of security and defence, Mauritius is essentially a client of India. The Mauritius National Security Adviser is a senior officer in [the] Indian intelligence [service] and has been for the last 40 years. The Mauritian coastguard's most senior officer is an Indian naval officer. Seventy per cent of the Mauritian population are of Indian origin. It's more or less an Indian client state.""

He adds that India will welcome any deal which guarantees a strong US presence in the Indian Ocean.

""I haven't seen details of the [Chagos] agreement, but I think there is a high chance that it will include an effective veto over any other military facilities in the archipelago,"" he says. ""India needs the United States in the Indian ocean, because otherwise there would be an effective power vacuum in which the Chinese would enter. The implicit understanding of the United States is that India will eventually take over responsibilities in the Indian Ocean. But 99 years [of the lease] is about as long as it gets in international affairs. It's a statement that the United States is there to stay as long as it wishes to be. It will exclude China from having a role in the Chagos. It's a good news story.""

Barring a sharp change in plan, the UK will soon hand the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius in exchange for the guaranteed lease on Diego Garcia. The US and India, between them, will provide a bulwark against Chinese expansion. Whatever happens, it seems certain that the great powers will continue to use these tiny islands as chess pieces, regardless of what it means for those who live there. The Chagossians of Diego Garcia were not the first islanders to suffer for the whims of geopolitics; the Agalegans will not be the last.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Malaysia, Beijing, UK, hooey, Taiwan, US, Madagascar, the United States, Spratlys, China, the Chagos Islands, Vietnam"
shipping routes,Tycoon Adani pulls request for U.S. loan to finance strategic Sri Lanka port,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/11/adani-withdraw-loan-sri-lanka-port-china/,"The withdrawal marks another low point in U.S.-India ties after the billionaire's indictment on charges related to fraud, and a blow to Washington's bid to counter China's regional clout.

NEW DELHI -- Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has withdrawn his request for a U.S.-backed $553 million loan to build a terminal for a deepwater port in Sri Lanka -- the latest fallout since his indictment in the United States last month on fraud-related charges rocked U.S.-India relations.

The American financing had been touted by the Adani Group as a strong endorsement from the U.S. government, and had been seen as a focused effort by Washington and New Delhi to counter Beijing's rising influence in the Indian Ocean.

The company disclosed to Indian stock markets Tuesday that it will forgo the loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation -- an agency created in 2019 during the Trump administration as an alternative to China's global Belt and Road Initiative -- and complete work on the port via internal financing.

The international terminal in Colombo, an expansion of the busiest port in South Asia and close to key international shipping routes, was crucial to matching China's clout in the strategically located island nation, after Beijing poured in investments for its own port and other infrastructure.

Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute, said the blow to the United States ""is more than symbolic. It is strategic in the sense that this really was an initiative that U.S. officials saw as a way to meaningfully counter China's own activities in terms of infrastructure investments in the broader region.""

The loan would have been the U.S. government's largest infrastructure investment in Asia and its first funding of an Adani project.

When it was announced in November 2023, the loan was hailed by the Adani Group as a ""ringing endorsement"" of the company and a sign of Washington's confidence in its ability. It came as a much-needed boost after Hindenburg Research, a New York-based short-seller firm, published extensive allegations of fraud related to the company in early 2023, causing its shares to plummet.

Last month's indictments have unsettled relations between India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Biden administration, even though President Joe Biden's Asia policy has kept India as a main pillar in competing with China.

BJP leaders last week accused ""the U.S. deep state"" of using ""false narratives"" to destabilize India and its key businesses. The claim came on the heels of the U.S. Justice Department's allegation that Adani was involved in the payment of more than $250 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure business contracts.

""On Biden's watch, the once-blossoming U.S. relationship with India has been fraying due to several issues,"" said Brahma Chellaney, a strategic studies professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.

""In fact, the U.S. indictment of Adani is widely seen in New Delhi as indirectly targeting [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi given the perceived closeness of the tycoon with the prime minister. Restoring the bilateral relationship with India -- critical to the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific -- is one of the foreign policy tasks that awaits the incoming Trump administration.""

Adani's global ambitions -- which have often followed in lockstep with Modi's diplomatic ventures -- have faced several setbacks since the Justice Department charges.

In Kenya and Bangladesh, Adani Group projects have been dropped or are under investigation, while public sentiment has begun to turn against the company. French energy giant TotalEnergies paused further investments in the company.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said last month that it would conduct due diligence on the group's loan request and had not disbursed any money to it yet. Sri Lankan leaders told local reporters after the indictment that the country would investigate Adani's local investments.

In India, meanwhile, speculation is rife over whether the indictment will be withdrawn under the administration of Donald Trump, though some experts say he could use it as leverage in bilateral negotiations on issues such as trade and potential tariffs.

But Adani has signaled his eagerness for a Trump administration. In a post on X congratulating Trump on his election victory, Adani promised to invest $10 billion in U.S. energy and infrastructure projects that would ""create up to 15,000 jobs.""

""If there is one person on Earth who stands as the embodiment of unbreakable tenacity, unshakeable grit, relentless determination and the courage to stay true to his beliefs, it is Donald Trump,"" Adani said in another post last month. ""Fascinating to see America's democracy empower its people and uphold the nation's founding principles.""

In the wake of the allegations, Asia's second-richest man has positioned himself as the victim.

""The more bold your dreams, the more the world will scrutinize you,"" Adani said in his first public appearance after the indictment last month. ""Every attack makes us stronger.""",,"million, million, billion",,N/A,N/A,"India, Kenya, Beijing, U.S., New Delhi, Washington, America, Modi, Colombo, Sri Lanka, U.S.-India, China, the United States, New York"

In a stock exchange filing, Adani Ports said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"".

""We would like to inform that Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project in Sri Lanka is progressing well and is on track for commissioning by early next year,"" said the flagship Adani Group company.

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan. We have withdrawn our request for financing from the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC),"" it added.

In November last year, the US International Development Finance Corp agreed to provide a $553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of CWIT at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

The CWIT project was started in September 2021, when Adani Ports signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, pledging over $700 million to expand the capabilities of Colombo Port.

The CWIT will be Sri Lanka's largest and deepest container terminal, with a quay length of 1,400 metres and an alongside depth of 20 metres.

The Port of Colombo is the largest and busiest trans-shipment port in the Indian Ocean and it has been operating at more than 90 per cent utilisation since 2021, signalling its need for additional capacity.

The new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, taking advantage of Sri Lanka's prime position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets.

An entity majority-owned by Adani, who was indicted in US courts last month, said in a company filing on Tuesday that it was exiting talks on a loan valued at $553 million from the US International Development Finance Corporation. After the bribery allegations came to light last month, the US agency said it was still conducting due diligence and hadn't reached a final agreement on the loan.

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan,"" the filing said, referencing the financing deal for a port terminal in Colombo being developed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. ""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC.""

The statement made no mention of the indictment of Adani, Asia's second-richest man, and other executives of his Adani Group. They were indicted in US courts on charges last month that they paid or promised to pay more than $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts, and concealed the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors. The company has denied the US allegations.

The White House and the Development Finance Corp., a government agency established to aid developing nations while advancing US foreign policy goals, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the withdrawal statement. Construction has already begun on the project, which also has local Sri Lankan partners.

The loan agreement for the terminal in Sri Lanka was signed last year amid US enthusiasm to offer an alternative to China for infrastructure investment in the developing world. Initially scheduled to be operational by December 2024, the deepwater West Container Terminal in Colombo was set to be the US government agency's largest infrastructure investment in Asia, and among its biggest globally.

""It is a high priority for the US to be active in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Scott Nathan, the DFC's chief executive officer, told reporters in Colombo in November 2023. ""It is obviously the engine of economic growth for the world.""

He was joined at the time by Karan Adani, the tycoon's son and chief executive officer at Adani Ports, who said the deal was ""reaffirmation by the international community of our vision, our capabilities and our governance."" At the time, the Adani Group had been fighting a raft of corporate fraud allegations leveled by short seller Hindenburg Research and various media investigations, which it had repeatedly denied.

Yet the US and Adani failed to seal the deal in the ensuing months, and no American financing had been disbursed before the announcement that talks on the loan were ending.

The project is continuing at the moment, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Sirimevan Ranasinghe said to a query from Bloomberg News about the absence of DFC funding. The company will bring in the FDI probably as originally planned, he said, referring to the entity-led by Adani Ports that's handling the port project.

Despite the US indictment, the Adani Group has sought to show that it's conducting business as usual. Its billionaire founder sat close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public conference, where the group pledged tens of billions of dollars in fresh domestic investment.

Adani's sprawling empire, which runs from construction projects to media properties, has been under fire since the Department of Justice's announcement, with Kenya canceling $2.6 billion worth of airport and power transmission contracts the tycoon's conglomerate had pitched for in the hours after the ruling.

Billionaire Gautam Adani's group has pulled out of a loan deal with a US agency to fund a port terminal in Sri Lanka, saying it will use its own resources for the project.

In an exchange filing late on Tuesday, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"".

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan,"" the firm said. ""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)"".

The US IDF had in November last year agreed to provide a USD 553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of a deep-water container terminal called the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

DFC financing was part of the US government's broader efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region and was seen as an endorsement of Adani's ability to develop world-class infrastructure.

However, the loan process stalled after the DFC asked that the agreement between Adani and the SLPA be amended to align with their conditions, which then went under review by Sri Lanka's Attorney General.

As the project is nearing completion, Adani Ports, which holds 51 per cent of the venture, chose to proceed with the project without funding from the DFC, officials privy to the process explained.

The US agency had recently stated that it was ""actively assessing the ramifications"" of the bribery allegations against the Adani group executives. It had so far not disbursed any money to the ports-to-energy conglomerate.

Last month, the US Department of Justice charged the Adani group's founder chairman Gautam Adani, and seven others over allegedly conspiring to pay USD 265 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure lucrative solar power supply contracts that were expected to yield USD 2 billion in profits over 20 years.

Adani Group has denied all charges as baseless and vowed to pursue all possible legal recourse.

The Port of Colombo is the largest and busiest transhipment port in the Indian Ocean. It has been operating at more than 90 per cent utilisation since 2021, signalling its need for additional capacity.

The geopolitically sensitive port project in Sri Lanka is as much of a move by the US to counter Chinese influence in the island nation.

Phase 1 of the project is scheduled to become commercially operational by Q1 2025.

The new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, taking advantage of Sri Lanka's prime position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets.

The CWIT project was initiated in September 2021, when Adani Ports signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, pledging over USD 700 million to expand the capabilities of Colombo Port.

The CWIT will be Sri Lanka's largest and deepest container terminal, with a quay length of 1,400 metres and an alongside depth of 20 metres. When complete, the terminal will be able to handle Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) with capacities of 24,000 TEUs and is expected to have an annual handling capacity of over 3.2 million TEUs.

shipping routes,AI Agents vs. AI Assistants: Know the Key Differences,AiThority,https://aithority.com/machine-learning/ai-agents-vs-ai-assistants-know-the-key-differences/,"Tuning: Users can refine AI models for specific tasks without retraining the entire model. Fine-tuning uses labeled examples to customize the model, while prompt-tuning provides task-specific context to optimize performance.

AI agents are autonomous systems designed to achieve specific goals by acting independently, often requiring minimal user input. Unlike AI assistants, which react to direct commands, AI agents operate proactively, making decisions based on real-time data and the objectives assigned to them. These agents can learn from previous interactions, adapt to changing conditions, and collaborate with other systems or agents to complete complex tasks.

For example, an AI agent managing a logistics operation might determine optimal shipping routes dynamically by analyzing live traffic and weather data. Similarly, a customer service AI agent can resolve user issues by navigating workflows and offering solutions with limited human oversight. This proactive, adaptive capability allows AI agents to drive efficiency and innovation across various business functions.

How AI Agents Function

Unlike AI assistants, which require prompts for each action, AI agents operate autonomously after an initial prompt. They can strategize, break down tasks, and create workflows to achieve goals independently.

AI Agents vs. AI Assistants: Core Differences and Applications

AI agents and AI assistants share foundational technologies but serve distinct purposes, offering businesses and users different levels of automation and support. Understanding their core differences is key for leveraging AI effectively in various industries.

AI agents are sophisticated systems designed to perform complex tasks independently. They operate in dynamic environments such as self-driving vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and logistics management, where real-time decision-making is critical. These agents use advanced algorithms and real-time data to streamline operations, reduce human error, and manage intricate workflows.

For example, in healthcare, an AI agent can analyze large datasets to diagnose diseases or recommend treatment plans. In logistics, these agents can dynamically optimize shipping routes based on current traffic conditions, ensuring efficiency and accuracy with minimal human intervention. Their capacity to learn, adapt, and make autonomous decisions makes AI agents ideal for applications requiring continuous situational awareness and adaptability.

AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are designed to enhance user convenience through natural language interactions. They excel in handling routine tasks such as setting reminders, managing schedules, retrieving information, and resolving customer support queries. These virtual assistants prioritize usability and accessibility, improving the customer experience with personalized, conversational interactions.

In professional settings, AI assistants integrated with platforms like LinkedIn and Microsoft tools help manage emails, organize meetings, and provide workflow suggestions. Their reactive nature and user-centric design make them indispensable for tasks that require quick, personalized responses, improving productivity and user satisfaction.

While both AI agents and AI assistants utilize generative AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), their applications differ significantly:

AI agents often integrate with APIs and vast knowledge bases to process complex datasets, whereas AI assistants are designed to provide seamless, user-friendly interactions for managing simpler, task-based workflows.

Both AI agents and assistants have evolved from basic rule-based systems to advanced tools capable of learning, adapting, and even understanding context and emotions. Innovations like ChatGPT have accelerated this transformation, enabling AI to handle nuanced tasks with greater sophistication.

In healthcare, AI agents are improving patient outcomes through predictive diagnostics and tailored treatment plans. Meanwhile, AI assistants are enhancing customer service by delivering quick, personalized responses, streamlining interactions, and boosting satisfaction levels.

Conclusion

AI assistants and agents are redefining how we interact with technology and address complex challenges. While AI assistants enhance productivity through user-directed tasks like managing calendars and handling inquiries, AI agents operate autonomously to solve intricate problems, such as optimizing supply chains or refining marketing strategies through real-time data analysis. This complementary approach unlocks significant potential for improving efficiency across both personal and business domains.",,,,N/A,N/A,LinkedIn

In a stock exchange filing, Adani Ports said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"".

""We would like to inform that Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project in Sri Lanka is progressing well and is on track for commissioning by early next year,"" said the flagship Adani Group company.

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan. We have withdrawn our request for financing from the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC),"" it added.

In November last year, the US International Development Finance Corp agreed to provide a $553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of CWIT at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

The operation was led by Puttidech Boonkapue, the commander of the ECD, who directed Chatchawan Chuchaijaroen and Wanichaya Chaiprong among other officers to apprehend the suspect. Lee was charged with hiding and distributing goods that had not undergone customs procedures, a serious offence under Thai law.

Before the raid, law enforcement had been aware of a smuggling operation importing e-cigarettes into Thailand. These were allegedly being distributed to teenagers across the country.

After two months of investigation, officers discovered that the group involved frequently changed storage locations to evade detection, complicating efforts to intercept them, said Puttidech.

""The investigation took extensive efforts to finally pinpoint the operation's current base in Bang Bon.""

With the new lead, the ECD secured a warrant from the Thonburi Criminal Court, allowing them to search the premises where Lee was eventually caught. The operation is part of a broader crackdown on illegal imports, which has become a growing concern for Thai police.

Upon arrest, Lee admitted to owning the e-cigarettes, which were seized as evidence. He and the confiscated items were subsequently handed over to Bang Bon Police Station for further legal proceedings. The police are determined to dismantle the network responsible for this illicit trade.

""Our commitment to stopping illegal imports is unwavering, and we will continue to pursue those who attempt to bypass the law.""

shipping routes,"FAO: Funding Shortages, Conflicts Threaten Food Security in the Middle East",Asharq Al-Awsat English,https://english.aawsat.com/node/5090465,"The Middle East faces significant challenges in securing food supplies, including a severe lack of funding for agricultural projects and being home to eight of the ten driest countries globally. These issues are compounded by ongoing conflicts and wars that disrupt key maritime routes in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Black Sea, driving up food prices both regionally and globally.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that $500 million annually is required to support agricultural projects and sustain food production systems in 22 countries across the region. FAO Assistant Director-General Abdul Hakim Elwaer shared these figures during an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat at the COP16 conference held in Riyadh.

Elwaer noted that while FAO is involved in numerous projects across the Middle East, these efforts are mostly on a ""pilot and limited scale."" Scaling up these initiatives will require direct financial investments, particularly to support small-scale farmers, ensuring the continuation of agricultural production.

Rising Food Prices

Conflicts and wars have significantly driven up food prices worldwide. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted shipping routes in the Black Sea, while conflicts in the Middle East have affected navigation in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Gulf of Aden. These disruptions have limited many countries' ability to maintain food security, Elwaer explained.

""These conflicts cast a shadow over the entire region,"" Elwaer stated, noting that the effects are not confined to war zones but extend across neighboring countries.

Water Scarcity

In addition to conflict, climate change is a major threat to food security in the Middle East and North Africa. Both short- and long-term climate effects are severely undermining the region's ability to produce food sustainably.

The FAO official highlighted that eight of the world's ten most water-scarce countries are located in the Arab region, where the average per capita water availability is only one-tenth of the global average. In some countries, such as Jordan, this figure is even lower.

Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as well as Egypt and Jordan, are grappling with severe water shortages and are turning to innovative solutions like seawater desalination. Similarly, North African nations, including Libya and Tunisia, are experiencing high levels of water scarcity, while Algeria remains within the water-stressed zone.

Natural and Human-Made Challenges

Agriculture in the Middle East faces a dual challenge of natural and human-induced issues. On the natural side, climate change, water scarcity, urbanization, and population growth are all critical factors reducing agricultural productivity.

Elwaer emphasized that climate change, in particular, poses a grave threat to food security. One key impact is rising sea levels, which lead to saltwater intrusion into fertile coastal farmland, rendering it less productive for agriculture.

On the human side, financial constraints and limited investment in the agricultural sector are major hurdles to boosting production.

Agricultural Pests and Other Threats

Elwaer also highlighted other challenges to food security in the region, such as rising temperatures due to climate change and agricultural pests. He pointed to locust infestations, which are exacerbated by droughts and heat waves, as well as other pests like the fall armyworm.

Additionally, sand and desert storms are disrupting agricultural output by reducing the productivity of rangelands for livestock and damaging crops. These natural phenomena, alongside the broader effects of climate change, present a significant and ongoing challenge to sustainable food production in the Middle East and North Africa, the FAO official underlined.",,million,,N/A,N/A,"Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Riyadh, Tunisia, Russia, North Africa"

In an exchange filing late on Tuesday, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"".

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan,"" the firm said. ""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)"".

The US IDF had in November last year agreed to provide a USD 553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of a deep-water container terminal called the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

DFC financing was part of the US government's broader efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region and was seen as an endorsement of Adani's ability to develop world-class infrastructure.

However, the loan process stalled after the DFC asked that the agreement between Adani and the SLPA be amended to align with their conditions, which then went under review by Sri Lanka's Attorney General.

As the project is nearing completion, Adani Ports, which holds 51 per cent of the venture, chose to proceed with the project without funding from the DFC, officials privy to the process explained.

The CWIT project was initiated in September 2021, when Adani Ports signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, pledging over USD 700 million to expand the capabilities of Colombo Port.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) announced its decision to cancel a $553 million loan from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for the Colombo West International Terminal project in Sri Lanka.

Shares of Adani Ports were down 0.80% at Rs 1,238.60 at the time the article was being written.

The company said it would instead use its own resources to fund the project, citing alignment with its capital management plans.

In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Adani Ports said the Colombo project remains on schedule to be operational by early 2025.

""We would like to inform that CWIT project in Sri Lanka is progressing well and is on track for commissioning by early next year. The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan. We have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC,"" Adani Ports said in its exchange filing.

Last year, the DFC agreed to provide $553 million to help develop, construct, and operate the Colombo West International Terminal.

The project is part of a consortium involving Adani Ports, John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). Adani Ports holds a 51% stake in the venture.

WHY THE LOAN WAS CANCELLED

Although the DFC loan was seen as a strategic move by the US to counter China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean region, the process hit roadblocks. The DFC requested amendments to the agreement between Adani Ports and SLPA, which were later reviewed by Sri Lanka's Attorney General. With the terminal nearing completion, Adani Ports chose to proceed without external funding.

Officials familiar with the matter as per reports said the company's decision was influenced by the delay in finalising the loan and its confidence in funding the project internally.

Adani Ports signed the deal for the Colombo terminal in September 2021, pledging over $700 million to develop Sri Lanka's largest and deepest container terminal. The facility will have a quay length of 1,400 metres and a depth of 20 metres, enabling it to handle Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) with capacities of 24,000 TEUs. Once completed, the terminal is expected to handle over 3.2 million TEUs annually.

The Port of Colombo, Sri Lanka's largest transhipment hub, operates at over 90% capacity, underscoring the need for additional infrastructure. The new terminal will strengthen Sri Lanka's position on global shipping routes and support growing economies in the Bay of Bengal region.

Phase 1 of the Colombo West International Terminal is expected to be operational by the first quarter of 2025. The project aims to meet rising demand for efficient transhipment services and cater to expanding markets near Sri Lanka.

Adani Ports' decision to self-fund the project also comes amid legal challenges. In November, the US Department of Justice charged Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, his nephew, and others with allegedly conspiring to pay $265 million in bribes to secure solar power contracts in India.

Adani Group has denied all charges as baseless and vowed to pursue all possible legal recourse.

The DFC had earlier announced it was reviewing the situation following these bribery allegations. To date, no funds from the DFC had been disbursed to Adani Ports.

An entity majority-owned by Mr Adani, who was indicted in US courts last month, said in a company filing on Dec 10 that it was exiting talks on a loan valued at US$553 million (S$742 million) from the US International Development Finance Corporation. After the bribery allegations came to light last month, the US agency said it was still conducting due diligence and hadn't reached a final agreement on the loan.

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan,"" the filing said, referencing the financing deal for a port terminal in Colombo being developed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. ""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC.""

The statement made no mention of the indictment of Mr Adani, Asia's second-richest man, and other executives of his Adani Group. They were indicted in US courts on charges last month that they paid or promised to pay more than US$250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts, and concealed the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors. The company has denied the US allegations.

The White House and the Development Finance Corp., a government agency established to aid developing nations while advancing US foreign policy goals, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the withdrawal statement. Construction has already begun on the project, which also has local Sri Lankan partners.

The loan agreement for the terminal in Sri Lanka was signed last year amid US enthusiasm to offer an alternative to China for infrastructure investment in the developing world. Initially scheduled to be operational by December 2024, the deepwater West Container Terminal in Colombo was set to be the US government agency's largest infrastructure investment in Asia, and among its biggest globally.

""It is a high priority for the US to be active in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Scott Nathan, the DFC's chief executive officer, told reporters in Colombo in November 2023. ""It is obviously the engine of economic growth for the world.""

He was joined at the time by Karan Adani, the tycoon's son and chief executive officer at Adani Ports, who said the deal was ""reaffirmation by the international community of our vision, our capabilities and our governance."" At the time, the Adani Group had been fighting a raft of corporate fraud allegations leveled by short seller Hindenburg Research and various media investigations, which it had repeatedly denied.

Yet the US and Adani failed to seal the deal in the ensuing months, and no American financing had been disbursed before the announcement that talks on the loan were ending.

Despite the US indictment, the Adani Group has sought to show that it's conducting business as usual. Its billionaire founder sat close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public conference, where the group pledged tens of billions of dollars in fresh domestic investment.

Adani's sprawling empire, which runs from construction projects to media properties, has been under fire since the Department of Justice's announcement, with Kenya cancelling US$2.6 billion worth of airport and power transmission contracts the tycoon's conglomerate had pitched for in the hours after the ruling.

The DFC financing is part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region and is a symbol of Adani's ability to develop world-class infrastructure.

The U.S. agency recently said it was ""actively evaluating"" bribery allegations against Adani Group executives. It has not yet disbursed any money from the ports to the energy consortium.

Last month, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Adani Group founder chairman Gautam Adani and seven others for conspiring to pay $265 million in bribes to Indian officials in exchange for $2 billion in profits to secure lucrative solar power supply contracts over more than 20 years.

In an exchange filing late on Tuesday, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"" and added that the company will fund the ongoing project through ""internal accruals"", aligning with its capital management strategy.

The company said it has withdrawn its 2023 ""request for financing from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)"".

The US International Development Finance Corp, in November last year, agreed to provide a USD 553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of a deep-water container terminal called the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

DFC financing was part of the US government's broader efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region and was seen as an endorsement of Adani's ability to develop world-class infrastructure.

However, the loan process stalled after the DFC asked that the agreement between Adani and the SLPA be amended to align with their conditions, which then went under review by Sri Lanka's Attorney General. As the project is nearing completion, Adani Ports, which holds 51 per cent of the venture, chose to proceed with the project without funding from the DFC, officials privy to the process explained.

The US agency had recently stated that it was ""actively assessing the ramifications"" of the bribery allegations against the Adani group executives. It had so far not disbursed any money to the ports-to-energy conglomerate.

Last month, the US Department of Justice charged the Adani group's founder chairman Gautam Adani, and seven others over allegedly conspiring to pay USD 265 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure lucrative solar power supply contracts that were expected to yield USD 2 billion in profits over 20 years.

Adani group has denied all charges as baseless and vowed to pursue all possible legal recourse.

The Port of Colombo is the largest and busiest transhipment port in the Indian Ocean. It has been operating at more than 90 per cent utilisation since 2021, signalling its need for additional capacity.

The geopolitically sensitive port project in Sri Lanka is as much of a move by the US to counter Chinese influence in the island nation.

Phase 1 of the project is scheduled to become commercially operational by Q1 2025.

The new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, taking advantage of Sri Lanka's prime position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets.

The Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project was initiated in September 2021, when Adani Ports signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, pledging over USD 700 million to expand the capabilities of Colombo Port.

The CWIT will be Sri Lanka's largest and deepest container terminal, with a quay length of 1,400 metres and an alongside depth of 20 metres. When complete, the terminal will be able to handle Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) with capacities of 24,000 TEUs and is expected to have an annual handling capacity of over 3.2 million TEUs.

As of September 30, 2024, Adani Ports had approximately USD 1.1 billion (Rs 8,893 crore) in cash reserves and generated an operating profit of USD 2.3 billion (Rs 18,846 crore) in the past 12 months.",,,,N/A,N/A,"US, Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka's, Sri Lankan, China"

An entity majority-owned by Adani, who was indicted in US courts last month, said in a company filing on Tuesday that it was exiting talks on a loan valued at $553 million from the US International Development Finance Corporation. After the bribery allegations came to light last month, the US agency said it was still conducting due diligence and hadn't reached a final agreement on the loan.

""The project will be financed through the company's internal accruals and capital management plan,"" the filing said, referencing the financing deal for a port terminal in Colombo being developed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. ""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC.""

The statement made no mention of the indictment of Adani, Asia's second-richest man, and other executives of his Adani Group. They were indicted in US courts on charges last month that they paid or promised to pay more than $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts, and concealed the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors. The company has denied the US allegations.

The White House and the Development Finance Corp., a government agency established to aid developing nations while advancing US foreign policy goals, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the withdrawal statement. Construction has already begun on the project, which also has local Sri Lankan partners.

The loan agreement for the terminal in Sri Lanka was signed last year amid US enthusiasm to offer an alternative to China for infrastructure investment in the developing world. Initially scheduled to be operational by December 2024, the deepwater West Container Terminal in Colombo was set to be the US government agency's largest infrastructure investment in Asia, and among its biggest globally.

""It is a high priority for the US to be active in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Scott Nathan, the DFC's chief executive officer, told reporters in Colombo in November 2023. ""It is obviously the engine of economic growth for the world.""

He was joined at the time by Karan Adani, the tycoon's son and chief executive officer at Adani Ports, who said the deal was ""reaffirmation by the international community of our vision, our capabilities and our governance."" At the time, the Adani Group had been fighting a raft of corporate fraud allegations levelled by short seller Hindenburg Research and various media investigations, which it had repeatedly denied.

Yet the US and Adani failed to seal the deal in the ensuing months, and no American financing had been disbursed before the announcement that talks on the loan were ending.

Despite the US indictment, the Adani Group has sought to show that it's conducting business as usual. Its billionaire founder sat close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public conference, where the group pledged tens of billions of dollars in fresh domestic investment.

Adani's sprawling empire, which runs from construction projects to media properties, has been under fire since the Department of Justice's announcement, with Kenya cancelling $2.6 billion worth of airport and power transmission contracts the tycoon's conglomerate had pitched for in the hours after the ruling.

Colombo's port is one of the busiest in the Indian Ocean, given its proximity to the international shipping routes.

The policy, unveiled on Friday, identifies China as a potential ⁤threat in the region, citing Beijing's growing influence through its partnership with russia.

The policy, which emphasizes a⁣ ""North American Arctic"" approach, outlines canada's strategy to counter military and economic challenges posed by both Russia and China in the Far North. It highlights concerns over China's deployment of ""dual-use"" research vessels and surveillance platforms, capable of both civilian and military applications, in Arctic waters.

""Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal rules-based international system,"" the policy states.

While China has no territorial⁢ claims⁢ in the Arctic, its economic and strategic interests in the region are expanding rapidly. Leveraging its close ties with russia, which⁢ is facing economic strain due ⁤to the war⁢ in Ukraine, China is investing heavily in Arctic progress projects.

China's embassy in Canada swiftly condemned the policy, accusing Ottawa of misrepresenting Beijing's Arctic activities and discrediting its legitimate interests in the region.""China firmly opposes it,"" the embassy stated,emphasizing China's commitment to peace,stability,and lasting development in the Arctic.

Guy Saint-Jacques, ⁤a former Canadian ambassador to China, believes Canada's new policy is a necessary response to China's growing assertiveness in the⁤ Arctic.

""Of course, thay want to pretend that⁤ they just have good intentions,"" Saint-Jacques said of China, noting Beijing's recent⁢ efforts to position itself as a ""near-Arctic"" country with ⁤a stake in the region's resources.

Canada's⁣ Arctic strategy ⁤includes the ⁣opening of a consulate in Nuuk, greenland, a move seen as a counter to china's growing presence in the Danish territory.

The policy underscores the evolving security landscape in the Arctic, where climate change is opening up new shipping routes and attracting increased attention from non-Arctic states, including China.

Recent joint military exercises by Russian and chinese⁢ forces near Alaska and the Bering Strait have further heightened concerns about the potential for increased geopolitical⁤ competition in the region.

China's ambition to create a ""Polar Silk Road,"" a new shipping⁢ route through the Arctic, adds another layer of complexity to ⁢the geopolitical dynamics at play.As the arctic ice melts and new opportunities emerge, the competition for resources and influence in the region is likely to intensify, posing significant challenges for Canada and its allies.

Ottawa, Canada Kissing the ⁤frigid north: NewsDirect3 sits down with Guy Saint-Jacques, former Canadian ambassador to China, to unpack Canada's⁤ newly released Arctic foreign policy and its implications for the ⁤Sino-Canadian relationship.

NewsDirect3: Canada's Arctic policy ⁣identifies china as a potential threat, citing concerns about⁢ Beijing's growing Arctic presence and ""dual-use"" research vessels.How concerning is china's⁢ increasing presence in the Arctic⁣ region?

Saint-Jacques: ""Of course, they want to pretend they just have good intentions, but China has been actively positioning itself as a 'near-Arctic' country with a stake in the region's resources. Thier activities need to be monitored closely.⁤ Their ⁣investments, partnerships, and emerging infrastructure projects raise legitimate concerns.""

NewsDirect3:

⁢ China has dismissed the policy⁤ as a distortion of its Arctic ambitions. How should we balance cooperation with ⁢concerns about China's ambitions in the region?

Saint-Jacques: ⁤""It's a delicate dance. While China has economic interests in the Arctic, their strategic goals frequently enough align with Russia's, which stands in ⁢contrast to⁤ Canada's ⁤vision for a rules-based international order in⁢ the⁤ region.""

NewsDirect3:

⁢Canada's Arctic strategy emphasizes a ""North American Arctic"" approach and includes opening a consulate in Nuuk, Greenland. What is the strategic significance of this move?

Saint-Jacques: ""Strengthening ties with Greenland, especially in light of ⁣China's growing investments there, is a prudent step. It demonstrates Canada's commitment to regional partnerships and ⁢underscores its intention to remain a key player in shaping the future of the Arctic.""

NewsDirect3:

How will climate change further impact Canada's Arctic policy and the geopolitical dynamics in the region?

Saint-Jacques: ""Climate change is reshaping the Arctic landscape, opening up new shipping routes and accelerating the scramble for resources. This heightens the risk of geopolitical competition ⁣and potential conflict. Canada needs to be proactive in addressing⁢ these challenges thru diplomacy, international cooperation, and a ⁣robust Arctic strategy.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"ottawa, Beijing, ⁢Canada, Canada, canada, Nuuk, ⁢contrast, Russia, Ukraine, Greenland, ⁣China, China, Ottawa, russia, Alaska, china"

APSEZ will instead fund the project with internal resources. The project is progressing well and is expected to be operational early next year. This follows investigations into Adani by US authorities.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) has withdrawn its request for a $553 million loan from the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project in Sri Lanka and is funding the project through its internal accruals, the company informed the exchanges.

""We have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC,"" APSEZ informed the bourses late night on Tuesday.

The CWIT project in Sri Lanka is making ""good progress"" and is expected to be commissioned by early next year. Its funding will come from the company's internal accruals and capital management strategy, APSEZ said.

ET had reported that, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) which had approved a loan of $553 million for Colombo West International Terminal Pvt. Ltd. (CWIT), had not disbursed the loan.

In 2023, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) approved the loan to support the development, construction, and operation of a deepwater container terminal at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka. The financing was allocated to Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT), a consortium comprising Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones Limited (APSEZ).

Adani had said at the time that the Port of Colombo was the largest and busiest transshipment port in the Indian Ocean. Operating at more than 90% utilization since 2021, it highlighted the urgent need for additional capacity. ""The new terminal will serve the growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, leveraging Sri Lanka's strategic position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets,"" the company had added.

Although the transaction was approved in 2023, no funds had been disbursed, and the situation was under review, a DFC spokesperson stated in response to a query from The Economic Times.

""The project has not reached financial close or signed a loan agreement. We continue to conduct due diligence to ensure that all aspects of the project meet our rigorous standards before any loan disbursements are made,"" a fortnight ago, DFC said in response to an email query.

This comes after weeks of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigations and enforcing laws related to the allegations concerning Adani. ""DFC was aware of the recent allegations related to Adani and was actively assessing the ramifications in light of the DOJ announcement. We deferred to these agencies for any law enforcement matters and related issues,"" the organization stated. It also emphasized its commitment to ensuring that its projects and partners adhered to the highest standards of integrity and compliance.

New Delhi:

Billionaire Gautam Adani-led conglomerate on Tuesday said it will use its own resources to fund a Sri Lankan port project and not seek US funding.

In an exchange filing late on Tuesday, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd said the project ""is on track for commissioning by early next year"" and added that the company will fund the ongoing project through ""internal accruals"", aligning with its capital management strategy.

The company said it has withdrawn its 2023 ""request for financing from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)"".

The US International Development Finance Corp, in November last year, agreed to provide a USD 553 million loan to support the development, construction, and operation of a deep-water container terminal called the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) at the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.

The CWIT is being developed by a consortium of Adani Ports, Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

DFC financing was part of the US government's broader efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region and was seen as an endorsement of Adani's ability to develop world-class infrastructure.

However, the loan process stalled after the DFC asked that the agreement between Adani and the SLPA be amended to align with their conditions, which then went under review by Sri Lanka's Attorney General. As the project is nearing completion, Adani Ports, which holds 51 per cent of the venture, chose to proceed with the project without funding from the DFC, officials privy to the process explained.

The US agency had recently stated that it was ""actively assessing the ramifications"" of the bribery allegations against the Adani group executives. It had so far not disbursed any money to the ports-to-energy conglomerate.

Adani group has denied all charges as baseless and vowed to pursue all possible legal recourse.

The Port of Colombo is the largest and busiest transhipment port in the Indian Ocean. It has been operating at more than 90 per cent utilisation since 2021, signalling its need for additional capacity.

The geopolitically sensitive port project in Sri Lanka is as much of a move by the US to counter Chinese influence in the island nation.

Phase 1 of the project is scheduled to become commercially operational by Q1 2025.

The new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, taking advantage of Sri Lanka's prime position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets.

The Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project was initiated in September 2021, when Adani Ports signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings, pledging over USD 700 million to expand the capabilities of Colombo Port.

The CWIT will be Sri Lanka's largest and deepest container terminal, with a quay length of 1,400 metres and an alongside depth of 20 metres. When complete, the terminal will be able to handle Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) with capacities of 24,000 TEUs and is expected to have an annual handling capacity of over 3.2 million TEUs.

As of September 30, 2024, Adani Ports had approximately USD 1.1 billion (Rs 8,893 crore) in cash reserves and generated an operating profit of USD 2.3 billion (Rs 18,846 crore) in the past 12 months.",,,,N/A,N/A,"New Delhi, US, Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan, Sri Lanka's, China"
shipping routes,U.S. Navy's Arctic Dilemma: Icebreaker Shortage Sparks Concern,19FortyFive,https://www.19fortyfive.com/2024/12/u-s-navys-arctic-dilemma-icebreaker-shortage-sparks-concern/,"Key Points: The U.S. Navy faces a critical shortage of icebreaker ships necessary for year-round Arctic access, a region of increasing geopolitical and economic importance.

-With only two aging icebreakers, including the damaged USCGC Healy, the U.S. lags behind rivals like Russia and China. The Icebreaker Collaboration Effort Pact (ICE Pact), signed by the U.S., Canada, and Finland, aims to enhance production, reduce costs, and build closer security ties among allies.

-However, delays and cost overruns, including the Polar Security Cutter program, have hindered progress, threatening the U.S.'s ability to secure its Arctic interests.

The United States Navy currently operates 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nine cruisers, and around 75 guided-missile destroyers - but it lacks a type of vessel that could be increasingly important should it be required to operate in the Arctic.

Since 2022, the Pentagon has been warning that the U.S. needs more icebreaker ships. The ice may be melting in the great white North, but icebreakers are still required for the U.S. to have year-round access to what is likely to be an increasingly contested region.

The United States Coast Guard - which is part of the Department of Homeland Security not the Department of Defense - currently operates just two aging icebreakers.

The problem was made worse this past summer, when USCGC Healy (WAGB-20), the largest and most technologically advanced icebreaker, was taken out of service due to an electrical fire. That forced the cancelation of two scientific missions to the Arctic via the Northwest Passage. The other icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10) - which is like WAGB-20 homeported in Seattle - is tasked to travel to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, annually.

A 2023 study (updated in July 2024) from the Congressional Research Service concluded that the U.S. requires at least eight or nine polar icebreakers. As a stopgap, the Coast Guard announced it would acquire a commercial icebreaker and station it in Juneau, Alaska.

This is not entirely a new problem, but it is one that climate change could make worse. In early 2022, the Pentagon warned that it required additional icebreakers, especially as Russia has put renewed interest in the Arctic region.

The melting ice has opened up new shipping routes that previously didn't exist, while the region is rich in resources. To protect U.S. interests may require deploying warships to the Arctic - and while the ice is melting, it does return in the winter, necessitating the need for more icebreakers.

""Strategically, icebreakers provide persistent presence in a way that's not met by anything else in the maritime region,"" Randy Kee, who had served as the senior advisor for arctic security affairs with the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, explained in a Pentagon report. ""Remember, the Arctic is a maritime region, and icebreaking provides you year-round access to be able to go in the region.""

Without the icebreakers, the U.S. may ""not be able to participate in the opportunities opening up or protect its interests,"" the DoD further warned.

A major concern is that Russia is partnering with China, including in the Arctic, where Beijing has sought to extend its influence.

""We are seeing more and more activity where Russia and [the] PRC are working together, and the Arctic is the most recent area that we're seeing that,"" explained Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown ahead of a trip to Iceland in October to attend the Arctic Chiefs of Defence Conference, USNI News reported. ""It's something we all need to be paying attention to and to understand what they're doing together, and is it for some type of positive benefit to the collective whole, or is that something they're doing to challenge other nations and other interests?""

Washington will not have to go it alone in ensuring a free and open Arctic region. On the sidelines of NATO's 75th Anniversary meeting in July, the U.S., Canada, and Finland announced the formation of the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort Pact (ICE Pact).

""[It is a] trilateral arrangement to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers and other capabilities, alongside United States' allies and partners, labor, and industry. This collaboration is intended to strengthen the shipbuilding industry and industrial capacity of each nation - and build closer security and economic ties among our countries through information exchange and mutual workforce-development focused on building polar icebreakers, as well as other Arctic and polar capabilities,"" the White House announced.

Washington, Ottawa, and Helsinki have pledged to ""develop a joint memorandum of understanding that will outline a framework for how this arrangement will be implemented within each country - and a mechanism for adding or including additional allies and partners as participants.""

In the short term, each nation will begin to build icebreakers for domestic use, which could then be employed by allied nations in the Arctic.

""This arrangement will consist of three initial components: enhanced information exchange between the United States, Canada, and Finland; collaboration on workforce development; and an invitation to allies and partners to purchase icebreakers built in American, Canadian, or Finnish shipyards,"" the Biden Administration further acknowledged.

As they reach scale, it will reduce the cost of the strategically critical vessels for the three partners and other allies.

In April 2019, a contract was awarded to Mississippi-based VT Halter Marine - now Bollinger Shipyards - to build the first of a potential three Polar Security Cutters (PSC).

Progress has been moving at a glacier's pace at times.

The Coast Guard has faced cost overruns and delays, and the Congressional Budget Office warned this year that the lead vessel, the future USCGC Polar Sentinel, won't enter service until nearly the end of the decade. The ICE Pact is meant to help address these issues - and ensure that the U.S. will have the tools it needs to operate in a region that could provide new opportunities, yet be the stage for future conflict.

""In the Arctic, new, faster shipping lanes hold the potential to create new economic opportunities and drive down shipping costs. And in the Antarctic, our partnership can also foster increased scientific research and international collaboration,"" the White House added.

Of course, getting there is half the challenge - one that icebreakers could help solve!",,,,N/A,N/A,"Iceland, Finland, Beijing, United States', Mississippi, U.S., Washington, Canada, Juneau, Alaska, Russia, PRC, China, the United States, Ottawa, DoD, The United States Coast Guard, Seattle"

shipping routes,How a Gates Foundation-Backed A.I. Startup Tackles Weather Forecast in Africa: CEO Q&A,Observer,https://observer.com/2024/12/weather-forecast-balloon-ai-startup-interview/,"Palo Alto, Calif.-based WindBorne aims to tackle climate change by improving the accuracy of weather forecast using A.I.-powered weather balloons.

Africa's agricultural sector is grappling with a major challenge: a severe lack of reliable atmospheric data, worsened by the impacts of climate change. This shortage of data has led to inaccurate weather forecast, poor crop yield and wasted resources, especially in regions like sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture is the lifeblood of many African nations, supporting more than half of the continent's labor force. Yet, productivity has fallen 34 percent since 1961 due to climate change, more than any other region in the world, according to a 2023 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This decline creates a ripple effect, threatening food security, destabilizing ecosystems and damaging economies.

Accurate weather prediction can be a game-changer for the continent and its farmers, helping them make smarter decisions, reduce financial losses and improve food security. Africa's economic losses due to climate change are expected to range between $290 billion and $440 billion, depending on how much temperatures rise, according to the African Economic Outlook, an annual report published by the African Development Bank (AfDB). Despite the urgency, funding for climate adaptation remains woefully inadequate.

But there's hope on the horizon. WindBorne Systems, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based A.I. startup, is determined to transform how weather data is captured and utilized. The company was founded in 2019 by John Dean, a former engineer at SpaceX and Lyft (LYFT) building autonomous systems, through a startup program under Stanford University, where Dean dropped out as a graduate student to focus on the company. WindBorne aims to tackle climate change by improving the accuracy of weather prediction using A.I.-powered weather balloons that gather atmospheric data. The startup claims its A.I. model outperforms competitors like Huawei's Pangu and Google DeepMind's GraphCast, as well as major physics-based models like GFS and IFS.

So far, WindBorn has raised a total of $25 million from Khosla Ventures, Footwork VC and Susa Ventures. Its clients include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force. WindBorne also has a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $5 million in the startup to develop A.I. weather forecasting technologies and A.I. models tailored for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.

In November, Observer interviewed Dean about how WindBorne tackles one of Africa's most pressing climate challenges while boosting agricultural productivity, and how A.I.-driven solutions could play a pivotal role in the global fight against climate change.

The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Observer: Why does WindBorne focus its initial efforts on Kenya, and how does this region exemplify the broader challenges facing Africa?

John Dean: Kenya was a natural choice for our first area of operation due to its combination of significant challenges with data scarcity and a relatively advanced meteorological infrastructure. Our data is being used to support efforts in renewable energy integration, disaster preparedness and carbon capture -- all contributing to reversing climate change globally. Through partnerships with the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD), WindBorne addresses the data gap that has long hindered accurate weather forecast in the region.

Precise weather prediction significantly impacts smallholder farmers, who rely heavily on rainfall. For example, accurate forecast can inform farmers about the optimal time to plant or irrigate crops, maximizing yields and conserving resources. This can prevent costly mistakes like planting too early or wasting water before an imminent storm.

How does WindBorne's Global Sounding Balloons (GSBs) address Africa's weather data scarcity? How are they different than conventional weather balloons?

They gather critical weather data across the troposphere. Each WindBorne balloon weighs only 2.5 kilogram, equipped with proprietary sensors and advanced avionics, allowing for real-time data collection and precise navigation. Unlike other weather systems, GSBs can collect 150 times more data per dollar over land and 250 times more over oceans. Moreover, the new version of GSBs can fly autonomously for over 50 days -- significantly longer than the few hours traditional radiosondes can operate.

The collected data is fed into A.I. models, enabling hyper-local, actionable weather insights. Our innovation can potentially transform sectors such as agriculture, transportation and energy management across the continent and on a global level, providing more reliable forecasts for crop planning to energy resource management.

What makes WindBorne's WeatherMesh A.I. model stand out in the competitive field of weather forecasting?

WeatherMesh AI achieves high accuracy through three main factors: vision transformer-based deep learning, advanced in-house modeling techniques, and the integration of live atmospheric data from our observations. We custom-built a computing infrastructure that enables us to run these complex models effectively. Since its launch in February, we've been integrating unique atmospheric data into the model, leading to ongoing improvements in accuracy. A.I.-driven models are faster and far more computationally efficient than conventional weather models. WeatherMesh AI combined with GBS's ability to adjust altitude for targeted measurements ensures precise insights while being cost-effective.

How is the Gates Foundation partnership advancing WindBorne's mission in Africa?

The partnership enables collaboration with local meteorological agencies like KMD, ensuring that captured data is integrated into regional forecasts and meets the needs of local communities. Moreover, our local teams are also working closely with the KMD team to support their technical capabilities. So far, over 70 balloons have been launched from KMD's Nairobi headquarters.

Next year, we plan to establish a second launch site in the region to collect even more observations. The partnership helps us gather direct feedback and refine our products to meet each region's unique needs. Being on the ground and collecting live input is essential. As an end-to-end weather solution, we handle everything from gathering in-situ data to integrating it into models and collaborating with various stakeholders to build a comprehensive system that improves forecast accuracy and supports smallholder farmers across the region.

By proving the success of our operations, we aim to scale our technology across other African nations and broader developing countries.

What broader impacts could WindBorne's technology have on Africa's rural economies and beyond?

Our expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa aims to address critical challenges in crop yield optimization, food scarcity and GDP gaps, particularly in regions like Kenya, where losses on farms are nearly double the global average.

We are collecting key precipitation data to improve future forecasts by launching balloons during Kenya's rainy season. Over 2025, we will continue collecting in-situ observations, working with local agencies like KMD and IGAD to integrate the data into their models and WindBorne's A.I. systems. These improved forecasts will help farmers optimize planting schedules and water usage, ultimately enhancing crop yields.

Beyond agriculture, industries such as renewable energy, disaster response, aviation and construction stand to benefit from more accurate weather data. For instance, energy grids can optimize renewable resource integration while shipping routes can be planned to save fuel and reduce emissions.

What challenges are you facing to scale current operations in Africa?

Expanding to remote African areas involves logistical hurdles, such as infrastructure gaps and navigating regulatory requirements for airspace use, as approvals vary widely across countries. We aim to address these challenges by collaborating closely with local stakeholders and ensuring its technology remains cost-effective and sustainable.

To ensure sustainability and affordability, we will continue to strengthen our collaborative partnerships and work with global organizations like the Gates Foundation and local entities like KMD, we can leverage existing resources and it helps disseminate our technology more effectively and affordably.

At the core, WindBorne's designs are modular and scalable, enabling us to set up a site and collect observations at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions. Furthermore, for each site, we hire a local balloon launcher. Equipping local teams to handle operations ensures the technology deployment is cost-effective and sustainable while fostering ownership within the communities we operate.

How does WindBorne's open-source data approach empower local communities, and could it redefine how tech companies foster innovation and collaboration in underserved regions?

By making data easily accessible, we're fostering collaboration and innovation, working with local researchers, academics and private companies to create solutions tailored to Africa's challenges. This approach ensures that all voices are heard in decision-making, leading to more inclusive and impactful solutions.",50 days,"billion, billion, million, million",,N/A,N/A,"Kenya, Palo Alto, Nairobi, A.I."

shipping routes,Shifts in Arctic security | Clingendael,Clingendael,https://www.clingendael.org/publication/shifts-arctic-security,"Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine has disrupted global security structures, reshaping geopolitical dynamics with repercussions that extend well beyond Eastern Europe. As countries shift their focus and resources in response to the conflict, regions like the Arctic - vulnerable due to rapid climate change and its strategic location - face new and intensified security challenges. These challenges encompass both traditional military concerns, such as defence posturing and territorial stability, and non-military issues such as cyber vulnerabilities, resource competition, and environmental risks.

This policy brief addresses how the war in Ukraine and heightened NATO-Russia tensions have impacted Arctic security since 2022. It begins by examining regional geopolitical shifts, such as the strengthening Sino-Russian partnership and Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO.

The policy brief then considers economic and energy impacts, noting disruptions to Arctic energy projects and shipping routes due to Western sanctions on Russia, complicating international investments and access to critical resources like rare earth elements.

Next, the authors assess the increasing security threats, including rising militarisation and non-military hybrid challenges.

shipping routes,How Much Does Air Freight Cost? A Complete Guide,TechBullion,https://techbullion.com/how-much-does-air-freight-cost-a-complete-guide/,"Air freight offers fast shipping for businesses and people. Shippers send items through planes to reach locations quickly. The price varies based on specific elements that affect shipping costs. These costs change based on market demands and seasonal factors.

Weight and size determine the basic cost. Distance to the delivery location adds to the price. Speed requirements change the final amount. Market conditions and fuel prices affect rates daily. Companies use cost calculators to predict expenses and plan budgets. These calculators help businesses make smart shipping choices.

Small packages cost less to ship by air. Big shipments increase costs quickly. Express services add more charges to the base rate. Regular services keep costs lower. Peak seasons like holidays increase prices for all services.

Key Factors Affecting Air Freight Costs

The price of air freight services depends on these main factors that shape the final cost:

Weight sets the base price. Heavy items cost more to ship. Airlines charge by actual weight or space used. Weight limits exist for air safety. Extra heavy items need special handling.

Size matters in pricing. Big packages use more space in planes. Airlines measure length, width, and height to set costs. Small dense items often cost less. Large light items might cost more due to space needs.

Location changes prices. Far destinations cost more. Remote areas need extra transport steps. Popular routes often cost less. Some locations need special permits. Airport fees differ by country.

Speed affects cost. Fast delivery costs more money. Standard shipping saves money but takes longer. Next-day service costs the most. Economy service offers the best savings. Delivery time guarantees added extra fees.

Fuel prices change rates. Higher fuel costs increase shipping prices. Lower fuel costs reduce shipping rates. Fuel charges are updated weekly. Market prices affect shipping costs directly. Airlines adjust rates based on fuel costs.

A real example shows these factors: A business ships 50 kg from New York to London. Fast shipping costs $750. Standard shipping costs $500. The difference comes from speed and handling priorities. Extra services add more costs.

How Air Freight Charges Are Calculated

Airlines use two ways to measure shipping weight to set prices:

Actual weight uses scales. The scale shows the exact package weight in kg or pounds. Digital scales ensure accuracy. Weight records stay in shipping documents. Shippers verify weight at pickup.

Volume weight uses size. Airlines multiply length times width times height. They divide by 5000 to find the volume weight in kg. This method accounts for space use. Light but large items often cost more. Different airlines might use different divisors.

Airlines pick the bigger number between actual and volume weight. This number sets the price. The higher weight determines the cost. Shippers cannot choose the calculation method.

Example calculation shows this process: Package measures 80 cm x 60 cm x 40 cm Actual weight: 20 kg Volume weight calculation: (80 x 60 x 40) ÷ 5000 = 38.4 kg Airlines charge for 38.4 kg because it exceeds actual weight Price calculation uses the volume weight.

Types of Air Freight Services and Their Costs

Air freight offers different service levels for various needs:

Express freight moves fastest. It costs the most but delivers the quickest. Good for urgent items. Special handling ensures speed. Time guarantees come standard.

Standard freight balances speed and cost. It saves money but takes longer. Fits most shipping needs. Regular flights carry these items. Tracking shows delivery progress.

International freight crosses borders. It includes customs steps. Price changes by country. Documentation needs to increase. Security checks take extra time.

Service comparison shows clear differences:

Express costs $8-15 per kg. Delivers in 1-3 days. Suits urgent medical supplies. Includes priority handling. Offers full tracking service.

Standard costs $4-8 per kg. Takes 3-7 days. Works for regular business shipping. Uses normal flight schedules. Provides basic tracking options.

International costs are $6-12 per kg. Needs 5-10 days. Handles global trade items. Requires customs clearance. Includes international paperwork.

How to Save on Air Freight Costs

Smart planning cuts shipping costs through several methods:

Maritime shipping plays a vital role in ecommerce supply chains. More than 80% of the world's trade is carried by sea because sea freight is the most cost-effective mode of transport for shipping large quantities of goods.

However, this mode of transportation contributes to CO2 emissions, prompting ecommerce retailers to seek more sustainable solutions to meet their carbon reduction goals. These goals are becoming increasingly driven by regulatory requirements and growing consumer demand for sustainable practices.

Ecommerce's sustainability challenge

Retail giants like Amazon, Alibaba and ASOS have set ambitious climate goals. Amazon, for example, has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. A large portion of companies' carbon footprint comes from 'scope three' emissions -- those generated by supply chain activities like transportation and logistics.

According to PwC's 2024 report, 80% of consumers are now willing to pay more for sustainable goods, including good that are shipped in a more sustainable manner. This creates an opportunity for ecommerce brands to strengthen customer loyalty by adopting greener logistics solutions. As sustainability becomes a key differentiator, sustainable shipping is no longer a choice but increasingly a necessity.

Advancing sustainable shipping

Shipping has always been integral to global trade, particularly maritime feeder services that transport goods from major transhipment hubs to smaller ports. The environmental cost of conventional marine fuels is driving the maritime industry toward alternative, more sustainable options.

Green methanol is one such option, a fuel derived from biomass feedstock that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 65% compared to conventional fuels. As part of this effort, X-Press Feeders has already launched two green methanol-powered feeder services -- the Green Baltic X-PRESS (GBX) and Green Finland X-PRESS (GFX). Both services are centred in the strategic ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp-Bruges, positioning us at the forefront of green shipping in the region.

These initial services mark just the beginning of our journey. As we take delivery of more dual-fuel vessels throughout 2025, we plan to steadily expand our sustainable feeder network across Europe.

In line with our sustainability goals, we are also introducing the Book and Claim system, a flexible and scalable solution enabling businesses to reduce their scope three emissions. It is a versatile 'chain of custody' system used to monitor and control materials and products as they move through a supply chain. This approach allows customers to purchase emission-saving credits tied to the usage of green methanol across our fleet, even if their specific shipment isn't powered by this type of fuel. By participating, ecommerce retailers can transparently claim emission reductions, comply with greenhouse gas emissions and promote the broader adoption of sustainable fuels in supply chain logistics.

Why sustainable shipping matters for ecommerce

For ecommerce retailers, consumer expectations have evolved. Today's customers want more than fast delivery; they expect transparency about how their goods are sourced, made and shipped. Businesses that fail to adopt sustainable logistics solutions risk falling behind as consumers increasingly favour brands with stronger environmental practices.

The shipping sector, particularly feeder services, play a crucial role in enabling greener supply chains. Reducing emissions in the 'last mile' of maritime logistics, the route from hubs to regional ports, allows ecommerce companies to enhance sustainability without compromising on delivery speed or cost-effectiveness.

By adopting sustainable solutions like green methanol-powered vessels and the Book and Claim system, ecommerce retailers can reduce emissions in their supply chain while staying ahead of stringent carbon regulations and consumer pressures. These innovations not only allow businesses to avoid potential penalties but also boost their brand's reputation as an environmental leader.

Driving green logistics through technology

In addition to alternative fuels like green methanol, technology is also advancing sustainable shipping for ecommerce. AI-driven logistics optimization helps retailers streamline operations, reduce fuel consumption and minimize emissions. This technology enables businesses to forecast demand more accurately and optimize shipping routes, all while keeping their environmental footprint in check.

Collaboration across the supply chain is essential for achieving significant carbon reductions. Partnerships between ecommerce retailers and green logistics providers are driving the adoption of sustainable practices, positioning both industries for long-term success.

Conclusion: sustainable shipping is the future of ecommerce logistics

As ecommerce grows, sustainability is becoming integral to transport and logistics. Maritime shipping can help the ecommerce industry reduce its carbon footprint through the use of more sustainable fuels, such as green methanol, and digital optimisation tools that drive greater operational efficiencies. By embracing these innovations, ecommerce retailers can reduce emissions.

Sustainable shipping is not just a trend -- it is the future of transport and logistics in the digital retail landscape. Retailers that invest in green shipping solutions today will be better positioned to meet customers' needs and achieve their corporate sustainability goals.

By linking the UAE's Arctic partnerships with its approach towards tech diplomacy, it highlights how the UAE balances great-power relations, pursues strategic economic opportunities, and seeks to carve out a unique national identity as a modern and progressive Arab state.

Strategic decision-making in the UAE is rootedSamaan, J, L (2020) The Logic of the Emirati Grand Strategy.

Accessed on 10 October 2024 in long-term planning and calculated diversification whereby the UAE leverages both soft and hard power in pursuit of its national interests. Given its geographic position and the challenging neighbourhood it finds itself in, foreign policy decision making in the UAE requires pragmatism and flexibility for Abu Dhabi to be able to cultivate relationships with a diverse range of global partners. This diversification strategy, in turn, is central to mitigating its reliance on any single state for security or economic ties.

The UAE's status as a logistics and trade/financial hub, coupled with its state-led capitalism, enables it to extend its influence beyond its immediate region. By using financial investments, capacity building, and humanitarian aid as tools of diplomacy,International Crisis Group Report (2018) The United Arab Emirates in the Horn of Africa.

Accessed on 22 October 2024 this desire for recognition has been the driving force behind the UAE's push into both frontier sectors and regions where no other Arab nation has ventured. Equally important, elevating its status in the international arena enables the UAE to attract both global talent and investment thereby reinforcing its position as a leader in innovation and sustainability in the Arab world. By positioning itself as a forward-thinking and progressive Arab nation, moreover, Emirati rulers can bolster their domestic legitimacy and global reputation, especially among Western powers.

The UAE's engagement with the Arctic region must be understood within the context of its broader foreign policy framework whereby it has sought to navigate the shifting dynamics of a multipolar world, particularly in its relations with global powers such as the United States, Russia, and China. Its Arctic strategy is also a natural extension of its status-seeking endeavour. By entering the Arctic, the UAE positions itself as a pioneer in a region traditionally dominated by Russia and Western nations. By becoming an actor in Arctic infrastructure projects, research initiatives, and sustainability efforts, the UAE enhances its global standing and reinforces its image as a proactive and innovative state. Put simply, the Arctic offers the UAE a platform to signal its ambitions and differentiate itself from its neighbours who are, by and large, more regionally focused in their conduct of foreign policy.

However, to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the UAE's Arctic strategy, one needs to look into the country's technological diplomacy, and the case of G42 in particular, which exemplifies its delicate balancing act between the United States and China. As the nation's flagship AI company, G42 initiallyKhorrami, N (2024) The UAE's Foreign Policy -- A Dangerous Balancing Act?

In managing these relationships, the UAE has adopted a compartmentalisation strategy; that is, aligning with Washington's interests in critical sectors like AI while maintaining economic cooperation with Beijing in non-sensitive areas.

In the Arctic, the UAE's approach follows a similar trend of strategic compartmentalisation and great-power management. As a maritime nation and global maritime hub, its interest in the region revolves around investment in critical infrastructure such as ports and shipping routes. Much like its tech strategy, however, the UAE must navigate the complex dynamics between Russia, a significant player in Arctic affairs, and the US.

Russia is a central actor in the Arctic, controlling the Northern Sea Route, a shipping lane that is becoming increasingly viable as Arctic ice melts. The UAE has taken advantage of Russia's need for foreign investment, particularly as Moscow faces sanctions and economic challenges due to its invasion of Ukraine, and has investedMark Trevelyan, M and Stolyarov, G (2023) Russia strikes deal with Dubai's DP World to develop Arctic sea route.

Accessed on 10 October 2024 in Arctic infrastructure projects with Russia, including logistics, thereby gaining a foothold in the region and its valuable resources. However, the UAE has approached its partnership with Russia cautiously. Much like its tech strategy of balancing ties with China and the US, the UAE is careful not to overcommit to Russia in the Arctic at a time of growing geopolitical tensions.

This also explains why Abu Dhabi has been gradually expanding its relationship with Norway. The latter, a NATO member state with advanced technology and logistics industries, provides an alternative partner in the Arctic, helping the UAE to reduce over-reliance on Russia. This pivot towards Norway mirrors its tech strategy of diversifying partnerships to reduce dependence on any single country.

As the UAE expands its influence in sectors like green shipping, critical minerals mining, and defence and space projects, its partnerships seem strategically designed to achieve its long-term goals of economic diversification and sustainability. Norway, in particular, has emerged as a key partner in the UAE's Arctic pursuits, offering cutting-edge technologies and a stable political framework that align with Abu Dhabi's vision of growth through innovation and sustainability.

However, increased Emirati presence in the Arctic through closer cooperation with Oslo, could also be hampered by concerns with regard to the rights and responsibilities of non-Arctic states in the region's governance. Norway is likely to welcome UAE investments, particularly in green technologies and sustainable development, but may also approach with caution. There are concerns over how the UAE's growing involvement intersects with governance issues, potential security risks linked to its financial cooperation with Russia, and broader normative concerns, such as human rightsSkille, O, B and Fjelldalen, F (2024) Amnesty frykter Støre ikke tør bruke utestemmen under lunsj med emirat-prins.

Still, Norway's perception of the UAE might evolve as Abu Dhabi deepens its engagement in sectors traditionally dominated by Arctic states. More broadly, the UAE's partnerships with both Norway and Russia, and the strategic choices it makes, will have implications for Arctic governance. This presents a critical opportunity for Norway. As a leader in Arctic diplomacy, Norway could play a pivotal role in shaping how non-Arctic states like the UAE are integrated into the region's future especially as Russia, due to its isolation, has become more willing to cooperate with non-Arctic nations without fully considering the concerns and interests of other Arctic states.

The Canadian government on Friday released a document detailing this policy, including its plans to talk with allies to protect the Arctic from military and economic challenges posed by Russia and China.

The policy also envisions a major role for the United States and it notably reframes the Far North as the ""North American Arctic,"" a phrase Ottawa uses 13 times in the document.

It identifies a number of what it calls ""potential threats"" in the Arctic including China's regular deployment of ""dual-use"" research vessels and surveillance platforms - with both civilian and military applications - that are being used to collect data in the region.

""Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal rules-based international system,"" the new Arctic foreign policy says.

Although it has no territory in the Arctic, China is rapidly building up its presence in the region through Russia. Moscow is facing a severe budget crunch from its military assault on Ukraine and increasingly relies on unprecedented levels of Chinese corporate and state investment to develop its Arctic region. China's northernmost tip is about 1,500 kilometres from the Arctic.

The Chinese embassy in Canada on Friday posted a written statement on its website criticizing Ottawa.

""The Canadian government issued a so-called 'Arctic Foreign Policy,' which distorts and misinterprets China's Arctic policy and discredits China's normal Arctic activities in accordance with international law,"" the embassy said. ""China firmly opposes it.""

Beijing's mission in Ottawa said China deserves a role in the region.

""Arctic affairs are not only about the Arctic countries, but also bear on the greater interests of the international community,"" the embassy said. ""As an important stakeholder to Arctic affairs, China has always participated in Arctic affairs and strengthened co-operation with all parties on the basic principles of respect, co-operation, win-win result and sustainability. China is committed to upholding peace and stability and promoting sustainable development in the Arctic.""

Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said China has been styling itself as a ""near-Arctic"" country in recent years and is eager to gain access to natural resources in Canada's north.

He said he can see why Canada's new policy would upset Beijing. ""Of course, they want to pretend that they just have good intentions,"" Mr. Saint-Jacques said of China.

Ottawa announced last Friday it would open a consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, as part of its Arctic strategy - a move that Mr. Saint-Jacques said makes sense given China's interest in the Danish territory in recent years. ""The Chinese are very present in Greenland,"" he said.

""Threats to Canada's security are no longer bounded by geography,"" Canada's Arctic policy document says, adding that climate change is accelerating rapidly and opening up northern waters to more vessel traffic and ""non-Arctic states, including China,"" are also seeking a greater role in governance of the region.

Russian and Chinese nuclear-capable strategic bombers patrolled near the U.S. state of Alaska in the North Pacific and Arctic in July. Chinese and Russian coast-guard ships sailed together through the Bering Strait in October.

China wants to create a ""Polar Silk Road"" in the Arctic, a new shipping route as the polar ice sheet recedes with rising temperatures.

shipping routes,Mining the Arctic seabed threatens fragile ecosystems - Earth.com,Earth.com,https://www.earth.com/news/mining-the-arctic-seabed-threatens-fragile-ecosystems/,"The deep Arctic Ocean holds vast reserves of oil and natural gas, along with valuable rare earth elements and metals.

With climate change accelerating the melting of ice, these resources are becoming increasingly accessible. Mining in the Arctic will present significant economic opportunities but will also pose major ecological risks.

A recent study published in the journal Elementa highlights the urgent need to protect this sensitive ecosystem as human activity in the region intensifies.

According to estimates, the deep Arctic Ocean could contain up to 13% of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and 30% of its natural gas reserves.

Additionally, the region offers a wealth of rare earth elements and metals essential for building modern technologies.

The potential economic benefits of these resources have drawn increasing political and commercial attention, further fueled by the opening of new shipping routes and increased Arctic tourism.

""Climate change and the melting of sea ice are increasingly facilitating the exploration of the Arctic Ocean, but this also entails major ecological risks,"" warned Dr. Angelika Brandt from the Senckenberg Research Institute.

The Arctic Ocean's deep-sea habitats host a remarkable variety of life forms, many of which remain poorly studied.

An international team of researchers analyzed 75,404 datasets covering 2,637 deep-sea species. The findings highlight the need for more intensive research and international collaboration to fill existing knowledge gaps.

""Although we have made considerable progress in understanding the Arctic ecosystem with the aid of new technologies and infrastructures, there are still major gaps in our knowledge of the deep-sea communities living on the sea floor - as clearly demonstrated by our new study,"" said Dr. Brandt.

The researchers examined data from freely accessible databases, non-digitized scientific literature, and information facilities, focusing on samples from areas north of 66 degrees latitude and deeper than 500 meters. Their analysis revealed the following findings.

The phylum Arthropoda - that includes isopods and copepods - had the most individual records (21,405). Other prevalent groups included annelids, sponges, and mollusks, with the latter showing the greatest species richness.

The brittle star Ophiocten gracilis was found at depths exceeding 1,000 meters during a Polarstern expedition between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.

The Arctic features diverse geological structures such as submarine canyons, continental slopes, seamounts, and biologically generated formations like cold-water coral reefs.

""Not only did we comprehensively digitize important deep-sea data and publish it in freely accessible databases, but we also collected, checked, and comprehensively analyzed new deep-sea data. This enabled us to show that, contrary to popular belief, the Arctic Ocean actually has a very rich diversity of organisms,"" explained Dr. Hanieh Saeedi.

Despite these advances, significant gaps in knowledge persist, particularly regarding benthic biodiversity in the central Arctic's deep basins. The study's habitat maps link faunal groups to specific geomorphological areas, identifying regions with limited data.

""The intergenerational collaboration within the framework of the UN Ocean Decade and the international cooperation with deep-sea experts and the AWI were crucial for this study,"" stated Dr. Saskia Brix, highlighting the importance of collaboration.

The Arctic deep sea is far from the lifeless environment early explorers imagined. However, intensified international cooperation and active monitoring of environmental parameters and faunal compositions are critical.

""This is the only way for us to better understand the structure and function of the Arctic ecosystem and to ensure that measures are taken to preserve this unique ecosystem, which is of such importance to the northern hemisphere,"" said Dr. Brix.

""Especially in view of the increasing economic and political interests, the lack of data on benthic biodiversity - particularly in the deep basins of the central Arctic Ocean - poses a significant problem for robust management and conservation measures,"" noted Dr. Saeedi.

The untapped resources of the Arctic Ocean offer undeniable economic opportunities, but the stakes for its fragile ecosystem are immense.

As global interest in the region grows, prioritizing ecological preservation through research, international collaboration, and robust conservation policies becomes ever more critical.

Only by understanding the Arctic's deep-sea biodiversity can humanity ensure that economic ambitions do not come at the expense of this vital and unique environment.

shipping routes,Logistics sector to benefit from eCommerce popularity,The Star ,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/12/10/logistics-sector-to-benefit-from-ecommerce-popularity,"PETALING JAYA: Shipping diversions from the Red Sea have continued to weigh down on global trade, especially within the Asia to Europe regions, says Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd.

In a report, the research house said the diversion from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope had resulted in a longer voyage for the Asia-Europe route, which contributes to 30% of global container volume, thus reducing the frequency of calls to shipping lines.

""The World Trade Organisation (WTO) kept its projection for 2024 global merchandise trade volume growth at 2.6% and introduced 2025's at 3.3%, but said the lower water levels in Panama Canal is also disrupting the movement of shipping liners,"" it said.

Reports of extreme weather off Southern Africa's shipping routes as well as the worsening situation in the Middle East is likely to further impact the movement of shipping liners with a possibility of further cuts in the WTO's projection for global merchandise trade volume growth.

The report also said that stricter regulations on carbon emissions could pose more concerns to the seaport and logistics industry, particularly from the United Nations' International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the European Union (EU).

""While the exact implications of the regulation of IMO and EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on the seaport and logistics sectors remain unclear, the volume of containers heading to the EU will certainly be affected, especially those originating from China, which is a major exporter of iron, steel and aluminium to the EU,"" Kenanga Investment said.

The research house said overall, the sector's earnings saw a slight improvement in its recent third quarter results season with 25%, 25% and 50% beating, meeting and missing its forecasts, respectively, as opposed to 50% meeting and 50% missing its forecasts in the preceding quarter.

""Westports Holdings Bhd beat expectations with stronger earnings growth, despite only a marginal increase in container volume driven by the better yield from gateway cargoes and lower operating costs with recognition of lower depreciation cost,"" it said.

Kenanga Investment said Swift Haulage Bhd also met its expectations and it expects a strong quarter ahead for the group as port congestion eases.

It noted that Bintulu Port Holdings Bhd's results disappointed due to higher-than-expected operating and tax expenses, while Pos Malaysia Bhd's results were also more subdued on poor cost containment, with its core net loss plunging further into the red.

Meanwhile, the report said on a positive note, the boom of eCommerce has continued on and is a bright spot in the domestically-driven third-party logistics sector, which is less vulnerable to external headwinds.

Kenanga Investment noted the boom will spur demand for distribution hubs and warehouses to enable just-in-time delivery as well as reshoring to bring manufacturers closer to end-customers.

""It will also enable an efficient automation system and warehouse decentralisation to reduce transportation costs and de-risk the supply chain.

""There is also strong demand for cold-storage warehouses on the back of the proliferation of online grocery startups,"" it noted.

shipping routes,Q&A: The future of address technology and its role in shaping key industry trends,Digital Journal,https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/qa-the-future-of-address-technology-and-its-role-in-shaping-key-industry-trends/article,"Data insight, profiling and direct marketing solutions from part of 'address technology' - the systems and processes designed to aid retail in interacting with consumers.

To discover how this technology has evolved and what is likely to be on the horizon for 2025, Digital Journal spoke with Brent Francom, Director of Product Management at Smarty about this emergent area of digital technology.

Digital Journal: In today's competitive market, consumers expect seamless and personalized shopping interactions. What role does address technology play in helping retailers meet these expectations?

Brent Francom: Every customer wants a quick and easy checkout. With address autocomplete, customers find and select their address with just a few keystrokes and proceed to the next step in the checkout process. For businesses, it helps to reduce cart abandonment rates. Companies also benefit from autocomplete technology because it predicts and fills in addresses after only a couple of characters and in some cases, after only 1 keystroke. By implementing autocomplete, you're protecting your database by ensuring that only valid and accurate addresses are entered from the start, which leads to faster deliveries and fewer mix-ups.

Today's shoppers love a personalized touch, and address data is an effective tool for companies to serve customers with curated offers. With verified location data, companies can offer special promotions or shipping options catered to each customer, like local pickup, same-day delivery, or eco-friendly choices based on where they live. You can also recommend products that match customers' climate -- like winter gear in chillier areas or climbing gear in mountainous regions.

DJ: What advancements do you foresee in address technology that could further elevate the customer experience, from faster fulfillment to personalized interactions?

Francom: As technology evolves, I expect predictive addressing to become even more intelligent. Soon, AI technology could suggest addresses based on how customers behave or where they've been. Another improvement to look for is using geographical data to enhance address suggestions instead of relying on IP addresses. Since IPs aren't always accurate due to VPN tech, etc., having permission to use a customer's actual location can mean more personalized address recommendations are also available.

Regarding security, advancements in address verification will likely bring multi-layered methods that use geolocation and behavior data to keep purchases safe. With real-time checks -- like matching recent address entries with delivery locations and payment details -- companies can help protect customers and build trust in every transaction. Multi-form authentication will gain even more traction than it already has.

Advancing address technology also implies that companies will gain access to real-time data that helps them understand what customers want based on where they live and how they move around. This will help you adjust your inventory, marketing strategies, and logistics to deliver top-notch services that cater to different regions.

High-quality address data makes shopping faster, more accurate, and personalized. As these innovations unfold, companies will benefit from significant improvements in fulfilling orders, connecting with customers, and building trust efficiently with secure and reliable interactions.

DJ: For retailers and e-commerce platforms, accurate address data is essential to minimize delivery errors and ensure customer satisfaction. How is address technology specifically improving operational efficiency in these sectors?

Francom: Address technology, particularly tools like autocomplete and verification, plays an increasingly vital role in retail and ecommerce operations, especially during peak shopping seasons when efficiency and accuracy are critical because no company wants to be responsible for an undelivered gift.

The checkout experience can make or break a sale. Autocomplete technology speeds up the process by reducing the number of fields a customer must fill out and minimizes typing errors. Given that the global average cart abandonment rate is around 70%, this technology allows customers to enter just a few characters to retrieve a complete, accurate address, resulting in a smoother and faster checkout that directly correlates to higher conversion rates and fewer abandoned carts.

Accurate address data prevents delivery mishaps, which could frustrate customers and lead to increased return rates. Address verification confirms the validity of each address, identifying potential typos or incomplete information in real-time before the shipping process begins. This accuracy is essential for last-mile delivery, where issues with address details can cause delays, redelivery costs, and unhappy customers.

DJ: What role do you see address technology playing in enhancing last-mile delivery performance?

Francom: Accurate address data supports more efficient inventory allocation and logistics. With verified addresses, retailers can better predict demand in specific areas, optimize shipping routes, and reduce overall logistics costs by avoiding misdeliveries and related operational adjustments.

An efficient, error-free checkout and reliable delivery experience create a positive impression on customers, which is significant in the competitive retail and ecommerce sectors. Retailers can enhance shopping experiences by using address data to offer region-specific promotions, product recommendations, and tailored delivery options based on location data.

Address data is integral in reducing manual errors, streamlining the checkout process, optimizing logistics, and improving customer satisfaction, all of which enhance last-mile delivery.

DJ: Financial institutions face the challenge of balancing compliance with a smooth user experience. How is address technology helping achieve this balance, and what challenges still need to be addressed?

Francom: Address technology helps financial institutions balance compliance and user experience by ensuring accurate, standardized, and verified address data for KYC (Know Your Customer) and fraud prevention. It also streamlines onboarding with tools like autocomplete that make it simple for the user to input their address and at the same time, reduce errors or incomplete addresses. On the other hand, one challenge that needs to be addressed is that many financial institutions are run on legacy systems, making it difficult to implement modern APIs. Having better integration tools will help connect legacy systems more seamlessly.

DJ: Accurate address information is vital for risk assessment and customer verification in the insurance sector. How is address technology currently being leveraged in this industry, and what future developments do you anticipate in the year ahead?

Francom: Location and address data are vital for the insurance industry. With an accurate address accompanied by a rooftop geocode, an insurer can evaluate risks associated with specific locations, such as flood zones, wildfire-prone areas, and even crime rates. This data allows for accurate underwriting information so that insurers can offer tailored policies and avoid under or overpricing. I anticipate that future developments will include AI and machine learning for predictive risk modeling, which will provide more accurate premium calculations and risk assessment.

DJ: In healthcare, accurate address data is essential for patient management and communication. How is address technology currently being applied in this sector, and are there emerging use cases that could further improve healthcare services?

Francom: Address data is applied in several ways in healthcare. The first is patient management. Address validation ensures patient contact information is accurate, reducing errors in medical records and facilitating seamless communication. Another use case is for service delivery in emergency response and home healthcare services. Geocoding helps emergency services locate patients quickly and accurately, especially in critical situations. With home healthcare, an accurate address ensures caregivers and medical supplies are delivered to the correct location.

Emerging use cases are population health insights, like location-based health trends and disease tracking. Health equity is another use case that can leverage address data to help identify underserved areas and guide the placement of new facilities or mobile clinics to mitigate healthcare gaps.

DJ: With increasing investments in AI and machine learning, how do you see these technologies influencing the evolution of address technology?

Francom: AI and machine learning could enhance address technology by improving accuracy, detecting and correcting errors, and enhancing global adaptability with localized and standardized solutions. AI could also enable address tools to adapt to diverse languages, formats, and cultural contexts, improving accessibility in international markets. ML can help with disparate address formats, streamlining global logistics and compliance. We could also see the expansion of address-free navigation that could be used, for example, in delivery and logistics for complex or unaddressed areas or for guiding emergency response teams with faster access to remote locations or non-standardized addresses during crises.

DJ: We're seeing address technology play increasingly unique roles, from facilitating complex delivery models to aiding infrastructure projects like fiber optic installations. As we look to 2025, what are some additional surprising or unconventional ways you envision address tech shaping business and societal needs?

Francom: In the future, I envision address technology will be integrated with geolocation services and 3D mapping to guide delivery drones to exact delivery points like balconies or rooftops. Additionally, services like food trucks or pop-up shops could use dynamic address systems to broadcast their real-time locations to customers. As it evolves, address tech could also guide users to nearby walking trails, parks, or outdoor workout zones tailored to their preferences and abilities.

The policy highlights Russia's weapons testing and deployment of missile systems capable of striking North America and Europe as ""deeply troubling."" China, meanwhile, has been deploying dual-use vessels equipped for military surveillance and research, raising concerns over espionage and resource exploitation.

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly emphasized the growing instability in the Arctic, stating, ""The Arctic is no longer a low-tension region."" The policy reflects Canada's intention to shift from a cooperative management approach to one that prioritizes sovereignty and security.

Key Components of Canada's Arctic Strategy

The strategy includes a mix of diplomatic initiatives and military enhancements:

Canada also plans to deepen Arctic cooperation with allies like Japan and South Korea, replicating partnerships seen in the Asia Pacific.

Russia and China's Arctic Ambitions

Russia has significantly expanded its Arctic military presence, conducting missile tests and building infrastructure to strengthen its dominance. China, despite not being an Arctic nation, has invested heavily in dual-use research vessels and infrastructure projects like the ""Polar Silk Road"" in collaboration with Russia. These efforts aim to secure access to new shipping routes and resources, capitalizing on the rapidly melting ice.

China's 2018 Arctic policy outlined its ambitions to develop the Northern Sea Route as a viable maritime corridor, potentially reducing shipping times between Eurasia and the Asia Pacific. This aligns with its broader strategy of enhancing global trade routes, even in regions beyond its traditional sphere of influence.

Why the Arctic Is a Geopolitical Hotspot

The Arctic's strategic importance is growing due to climate change, which is melting ice at unprecedented rates. This opens new maritime trade routes, such as the Northern Sea Route, and access to vast reserves of oil, gas, and critical minerals, including rare earth elements vital for clean energy technologies.

Global powers, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have updated their Arctic policies, while India has also announced plans to collaborate with Russia on Arctic exploration. These developments heighten competition and raise the stakes for territorial disputes and resource access.

Challenges and Regional Impact

The Arctic Council, established in 1996 to promote peaceful cooperation among Arctic states and Indigenous communities, has faced challenges since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The suspension of cooperation with Russia by the other seven member states has disrupted the Council's stability.

Environmental risks are also increasing. A 37% rise in shipping activity over the past decade has elevated the likelihood of oil spills, pollution, and habitat disruption for species like polar bears and seals. Military activity further threatens the fragile ecosystem, compounding the effects of climate change.

The Path Forward

Canada's Arctic strategy reflects a significant shift from collaborative management to assertive sovereignty. By addressing emerging threats and involving Indigenous communities, Canada aims to position itself as a leader in Arctic governance while countering the influence of geopolitical rivals. However, balancing security, environmental sustainability, and cooperation remains a critical challenge in the rapidly evolving Arctic landscape.",,,,N/A,N/A,"India, Canada, the United Kingdom, Eurasia, Russia, Ukraine, Japan, Germany, China, South Korea, France"
shipping routes,The shallow Baltic Sea holds deep secrets about a hybrid war on NATO,Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/shallow-baltic-sea-holds-deep-190245874.html,"BERLIN -- The shallow waters of the Baltic Sea have become a secondary arena of confrontation in the larger standoff between the East and the West. Fears of hybrid warfare, coupled with key vulnerabilities on both sides, make this narrow stretch of water one of the key areas to watch as hybrid warfare activities expand and NATO bolsters its eastern flank.

Recent events show just how seriously both sides are taking the challenge.

When two undersea cables were severed in mid-November - one connecting Germany to Finland, and one Lithuania to a Swedish island - Germany's defense minister was quick to announce that ""no one believes that these cables were cut accidentally,"" hammering the point home by adding that ""we have to assume ... it is sabotage.""

Soon after the cables were cut, armed vessels from several Baltic Sea states, including Denmark, Sweden and Germany, approached a Chinese ship that they suspected of having been responsible for the rupture, the Yi Peng 3, making its way toward the Atlantic. Visible damage on the ship's anchor and hull, seen by journalists from a Danish state broadcaster, suggested it may have dragged its anchor across the sea floor in an effort to cause damage.

NATO draws up plans for its own fleet of naval surveillance drones

Satellite-based ship tracking data implies a tense standoff with the ship stopped just a short distance outside of Danish territorial waters and being watched over by armed European vessels. A Russian warship was keeping nearby, spotted on satellite imagery. The ship's owner, China-based Ningbo Yipeng Shipping, told the Financial Times that ""the government has asked the company to cooperate with the investigation.""

It wasn't the first time that undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea mysteriously and violently disconnected. It wasn't even the first time that a Chinese cargo ship had dragged its anchor across a cable connecting two NATO states and caused considerable damage in doing so. In October 2023, the Newnew Polar Bear damaged a gas pipeline and data cables in the same manner.

And in September 2022, months after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting Russia to Germany exploded, leaving a gaping hole and taking them out of commission. While much blame was initially heaped on Russia, the Kremlin has denied any wrongdoing, and additional evidence has emerged since that complicates the picture. A perpetrator has not been publicly identified, although German authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man in connection with the incident.

So, what is going on in the Baltic Sea, and why is it suddenly so important?

With the recent accession of Finland and Sweden - two previously longtime neutral states - to NATO, many Western observers triumphantly declared the 386,000 square kilometer sea a ""NATO lake."" Russia, whose empire once controlled roughly half the coastline here, now holds on to only about 700 kilometers around Saint Petersburg and its Kaliningrad exclave wedged between Lithuania and Poland. Both are incredibly valuable to Moscow: Kaliningrad is heavily militarized and serves as the headquarters of the Baltic fleet, while Saint Petersburg is one of the region's most important financial centers and plays a major role in Russian foreign trade.

Kaliningrad is also Russia's only year-round ice-free port in the Baltic. And the territory's forward position much closer to Western Europe makes it prime real estate for stationing bombers and missiles, according to Moscow's calculus.

For Russia, as for the other states sharing the Baltic coastline, the sea and its narrow connection to the open Atlantic through the Danish Straits is a crucial link to global trade and commerce. Things get crowded there: Around 2,000 ships are in the Baltic at any given time, and the trade volume amounts to about 15% of the global total, according to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission HELCOM.

NATO drill sends divers, drones to sneak by underwater alarm sensors

It's not just what's on the water but what lies under it that has attracted attention - wanted and unwanted. Beneath the waves stretch dozens of cables transporting power and information between the tightly interconnected European countries on either side of the straits. These pieces of undersea infrastructure crisscross through national and international waters, under shipping lanes and across the exit from the Gulf of Finland, which harbors Saint Petersburg. They are joined by other maritime infrastructure usually found closer to the shore, like liquefied natural gas terminals taking deliveries of gas from countries that Europe has better relations with than Russia, and wind farms that were developed to bolster Europe's energy independence.

The cutting of undersea cables is not a new hybrid warfare tactic. During World War I, both the British and German navies severed the opposing side's underwater telegraph lines. The idea of hybrid warfare likely has become attractive for Russia due to the military imbalance with the West: Moscow avoids engaging in outright war by employing plausible deniability while still having the potential to undermine Western infrastructure, resolve and cohesion, explained Sebastian Bruns, a senior researcher at the Kiel, Germany-based Center for Maritime Strategy and Security.

""With thousands of kilometers of cables spread across the world's oceans, it is practically impossible to 'protect' them all in an efficient way,"" said Basil Germond, a professor of international relations at Lancaster University who researches naval affairs and maritime security. Instead, redundancy and deterrence must be employed. If a network is redundant enough, there will be no significant impact from an attack unless it is large-scale and coordinated, he argued.

The crowdedness and strategic importance of the Baltic to its neighbors means that it has played a central role in these countries' defense policies. For Russia, access to the Baltic Sea is vital to keep Kaliningrad supplied, as the exclave lacks a direct land connection to Russia and is surrounded by NATO members. To others, like Sweden, it presents the country's longest frontier and one that is remarkably tough to guard: With archipelagos, bays and sounds, there are plenty of places for unwelcome guests to hide, which led to repeated submarine hunts during the Cold War years.

As a result, Sweden and other Baltic states have developed uniquely adapted navies and military doctrines for the Baltic littoral environment. The Swedish navy operates a fleet of five submarines designed for brown-water operations near land - and is constructing two more - in contrast to the blue-water, deep-sea navies of other NATO states, and a set of seven minesweepers and other boats designed to operate close to shore.

The Baltic Sea is a unique environment, boasting an average depth of just around 55 meters. It is also considered brackish water (an in-between level between salt- and freshwater) due to the many rivers that empty into it. Layers of varying salinity provide ideal conditions for submarines to hide, especially the smaller ones capable of operating in the Baltic in the first place.

States around the Baltic Sea have been some of Ukraine's most ardent supporters, given their own proximity to Russia. Particularly the Baltic nations have sent outsized contributions to Kyiv's defensive war effort: Estonia and Lithuania gave 1.8% of their GDP to Ukraine and Latvia 1.5%, according to a report by the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank.

In September, NATO announced it would open a naval command center for the Baltic Sea in the German coastal city of Rostock to ""coordinate naval activities in the region"" and provide NATO with a ""maritime situation picture in the Baltic Sea region around the clock,"" according to the German military. Staff from 11 other alliance countries will be present at the HQ.

Russia decried the move as a violation of an agreement that no NATO forces would be moved to the territory of the former GDR, which the USSR had considered a precondition to agree to German reunification following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the East German government in 1989.

German defense minister Boris Pistorius argued the naval command center was necessary to ""ensure that Putin will not have his way,"" referring to Russian President Vladmir Putin.

According to experts, the quick response to the most recent case of severed cables shows that European preparation has worked. Efforts led by NATO have focused on better surveillance and operational coordination, said Christian Bueger, author of the book ""Understanding Maritime Security"" and professor at the University of Copenhagen. The involved governments' reaction to the Yi Peng 3 incident ""clearly indicates that the strategy and coordination on the NATO level work well now,"" he said.

Simultaneously, the increased attention has galvanized scrutiny of national and international legal frameworks for protecting undersea infrastructure and interdicting ships. Some countries, such as Belgium, have moved to introduce legislation criminalizing damage to critical infrastructure. On the other side of Europe, Portugal and Italy have led the charge in coordinating with industry and conducting legal reviews on the security of maritime infrastructure, said Bueger.

The part of the story that continues to perplex analysts is the China connection.

In both recent incidents, it was Chinese civilian vessels that appear to have dragged their heavy anchors along the seafloor for large distances on their way out of Russian waters and toward the open Atlantic, a pattern that has baffled marine experts. It is unlikely such a thing would happen accidentally, most say, and even less likely that it would go unnoticed by the crew for long stretches. Suspicious movement of the vessels near crucial undersea infrastructure and away from typical shipping routes further suggests intentionality rather than accidents.

In both cases last month, the Chinese government rejected any claims that it had been involved. Additionally, Chinese authorities appeared cooperative and, in the case of the damaged gas pipeline and data cables between Estonia and Finland, later even publicly stated that their ship had accidentally caused the damage.

Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on the more recent incident involving the cables around Estonia, Sweden and Finland that ""China maintains communication with relevant parties, including Denmark, through diplomatic channels."" Reporting from governments involved in the investigation seemed to support this and indicate a generally constructive attitude.

What exactly is going on here is hard to say. While China has an interest in undermining the West, broadly speaking, in its quest to replace the United States as the world's preeminent superpower, it has little reason to be focused on the Baltic Sea in particular. Nor does it have a significant track record of similar actions in parts of the world more relevant to China's immediate geopolitical ambitions, though it has used some methods that could be considered hybrid tactics in the disputed archipelagos of the South China Sea.

Several experts interviewed for this story said they considered it highly unlikely the Chinese government was directly involved. However, with Chinese shipping companies being among the few that still conduct business with Russia, they said there is a chance of their ships being employed - even unknowingly - for nefarious actions.

Both of the Chinese ships involved in the recent Baltic incidents had fairly close ties to Russia, beyond simply coming from a Russian port when the damage took place. The Economist has previously reported that the Newnew Polar Bear, linked to the damaged pipeline between Estonia and Finland, had a number of ties to Russia, including through its ownership, crew, prior voyages and shipping contracts.

While less is known so far about the 225-meter-long Yi Peng 3, reporting has emerged that suggests similar connections. Erik Kannike, an Estonia-based defense consultant, found that Russian federal port records listed the captain of the ship as being a Russian citizen. He also pointed out that the vessel's ownership was only transferred to the current company about a month before the incident. The presence of a Russian warship near the site of ongoing investigations further suggests Russian interest in the case.

Among the unresolved questions, one thing is certain: The Baltic Sea has shaped up to be a new frontier in the geopolitical cat-and-mouse game that has engulfed Europe since the escalation of the war in Ukraine.

Good afternoon, and welcome to Globe Climate, a newsletter about climate change, environment and resources in Canada.

Eyes are turning to the Arctic not just because of the evolving landscape, but for updated military objectives as well.

Canada will begin security talks with allies, including the United States, on how to protect the Arctic from military and economic challenges. Another pressing issue is climate change, as melting ice opens up new shipping routes and opportunities for mineral exploration. More on that below.

Now, let's catch you up on other news.

The Northwest Passage cuts through Canada's Arctic, forming an important shipping corridor across the top of the world. It's also one of the focal points of the Canadian Armed Forces' Northern operations.

Every year, the CAF deploys soldiers to four locations in the North for a series of activities, called Operation Nanook, intended to show Canada's presence in what is becoming a more heavily trafficked area. One of these deployments, Nanook-Nunakput, focuses on the shipping corridor.

The waters of the passage, stewarded by the Inuit for thousands of years, are contested. Canada calls the passage an internal waterway, but many other countries consider it an ""international strait."" The area is also vulnerable to global warming, which affects its security.

""As the climate warms up, the Northwest Passage becomes more trafficable,"" says Major Alex Gagnier, 1CER Task Force Commander. ""And when it becomes more trafficable, there's more economic interest.""

The threat of accidents and spills is increasing. With the CAF in the area, it's hoped Canada can more nimbly respond to disaster of any kind north of the 60th parallel. ""Forest fires, floods - anything that requires us to get to remote regions quickly,"" says Rob Huebert, a professor at the University of Calgary who specializes in Arctic sovereignty and security.

Indigenous knowledge of the land is recognized as an invaluable part of the CAF operations in the Arctic. The soldiers rely on the Canadian Rangers, a subcomponent of the Canadian Army Reserve that in the Arctic largely consists of Indigenous and northern community members.

Many Arctic residents hope that the increased military presence will come with more developed infrastructure, leading to improved quality of life.

Though much of the strategy remains classified, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will implement a new counter-drone office within the Pentagon - Joint Counter-Small UAS Office - and a new Warfighter Senior Integration Group, according to a new memo.

The Pentagon will also begin work on a second Replicator initiative, but it will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to fund this plan. The first Replicator initiative worked to field inexpensive, dispensable drones to thwart drone attacks by adversarial groups across the Middle East and elsewhere.

The memo warned that the increased use of unmanned systems must reshape U.S. tactics, as they make it easier for adversaries to ""surveil, disrupt and attack our forces ... potentially without attribution.""

US SCRAMBLES AS DRONES SHAPE THE LANDSCAPE OF WAR: 'THE FUTURE IS HERE'

The plan outlines a five-pronged approach: deepening understanding of enemy drones, launching offensive campaigns to thwart their ability to build such systems, improving ""active and passive"" defenses to such attacks, rapid increase of production of counter-drone systems and making counter-drone focus a top priority for future force development.

For the past year, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been using small, one-way unmanned aerial systems to strike western shipping routes in the Red Sea.

That has led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

Some experts have deemed the U.S. response inadequate in deterring the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

Additionally, the cost of U.S. response to such attacks is disproportionate. While the Houthi drones are estimated to cost around $2,000 each, the naval missiles the U.S. fires back can run around $2 million a shot.

In September, Houthis took out two U.S. Reaper drones in a week, machinery that costs around $30 million a piece.

Deadly drone strikes have also been launched by both sides in Russia's war on Ukraine.

""Unmanned systems pose both an urgent and enduring threat to U.S. personnel, facilities, and assets overseas,"" the Pentagon said in a statement on Thursday announcing the strategy.

""By producing a singular Strategy for Countering Unmanned Systems, the Secretary and the Department are orienting around a common understanding of the challenge and a shared approach to addressing it.""

Three U.S. service members were killed in a drone strike in January in Jordan. Experts warned the U.S. lacks a clear counter-drone procedure after 17 unmanned vehicles traipsed into restricted airspace over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last December.

IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS

The mystery drones swarmed for more than two weeks. Lack of a standard protocol for such incursions left Langley officials unsure of what to do - other than allow the 20-foot-long drones to hover near their classified facilities.

Langley is home to some of the nation's most vital top secret facilities and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters.

Two months prior to Langley, in October 2023, five drones flew over the Energy Department's Nevada National Security Site, used for nuclear weapons experiments. U.S. authorities were not sure who was behind those drones either.

A Chinese surveillance balloon traversed over the U.S. for a week last year before the Air Force shot it down off the coast.

Over two billion people lack access to safe drinking water, while more than four billion face severe water scarcity. To address global water security challenges, immediate collective intervention is needed.

This was the key message from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's speech at the One Water Summit held in Riyadh on 3 December, co-organised with France, Saudi Arabia and the World Bank.

Highlighting water as essential for sustainable development, economic progress, and environmental preservation, Tokayev called for collective action to ensure universal access to clean water, protect water resources, build disaster resilience, and foster international cooperation.

Tokayev stressed the importance of investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, innovative irrigation systems, and technological advancements to combat pollution and stabilise water availability.

He proposed establishing a global research partnership to protect glaciers, which are vital to sustaining billions of people worldwide. Tokayev also mentioned the critical need for strengthening early warning systems to mitigate water-related disasters, which annually affect over 1.5 billion people.

Tokayev underscored water security as a moral imperative and a central pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. He advocated for water-efficient agriculture and renewable energy as strategic measures to enhance economic resilience.

Kazakhstan will host a Regional Climate Conference in 2026 in partnership with the United Nations, aiming to advance global water initiatives.

Preserving lake Balkhash

Among the key initiatives presented to address critical water resource challenges at the summit was the preservation of Lake Balkhash in southeastern Kazakhstan, one of the largest lakes in Asia and the 15th largest in the world.

Kazakhstan's Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation signed a trilateral agreement with the French Development Agency (AFD) and the French Bureau of Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) to enhance cooperation.

The agreement includes a €1.35 million grant to the Kazakh ministry for developing a sustainable water management plan for the lake, with a comprehensive study of the lake basin conducted by the French side.

The study will inform a long-term master plan for managing the lake's water resources until 2040. The project aims to stabilise the lake's water levels by optimising the operation of the Qapshagai Reservoir.

Additional measures will include cleaning rivers, preventing soil and water pollution, supporting fisheries, promoting ecotourism, and establishing legal frameworks to protect the lake.

Meanwhile, efforts to revive the North Aral Sea also continue, with preparations for the second phase of a project to improve the region's hydrology and support sustainable development in the Kyzylorda area.

Solving Central Asia's water crisis

The water crisis along the Caspian Sea and the broader Central Asian region threatens the livelihoods of over 82 million people in the C5 nations: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

This crisis, marked by shrinking water bodies, stems from climate change, population growth, outdated Soviet-era water infrastructure, and mismanagement.

Up to 40 per cent of irrigation water and 55 per cent of drinking water are lost during transit due to dilapidated systems while rising temperatures and glacial melting jeopardise future water availability.

According to a publication of the Atlantic Council, the West has an important role to play in solving Central Asia's water crisis through a strategy for regional and international collaboration to address the crisis without requiring massive new investments.

The report emphasises improving water infrastructure, enhancing irrigation efficiency, and fostering interstate cooperation to buy time for developing sustainable solutions.

The Aral Sea disaster illustrates the dire consequences of mismanagement, with over 90 per cent of its waters lost since the 1960s due to river diversions for irrigation, argues the report.

While Kazakhstan's Kok-Aral Dam project has achieved partial restoration, Uzbekistan's continued water usage from cotton farming hinders further recovery. Similarly, the Caspian Sea is at risk due to reduced water inflows, desalination projects, and industrial demands.

Declining water levels threaten regional shipping routes, such as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), otherwise known as the Middle Corridor, essential for trade between Central Asia, China, and Europe.

The report suggests the engagement of the United States and Western countries in mitigating the crisis while strengthening ties with the region. Initiatives could include public-private partnerships, instruments in water-saving technologies, and modernising water infrastructure.

The Atlantic Council argues the US can leverage platforms like the B5+1 diplomatic framework to promote private-sector involvement in Central Asia, addressing challenges while reducing the region's dependency on Russia and China.

Western engagement in these efforts could help stabilise the region, prevent potential conflicts over water resources, and secure a more sustainable future, concludes the report.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Riyadh, Kyrgyzstan, US, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, China, the United States, Tajikistan, France"
shipping routes,Pentagon announces new counter-drone strategy as unmanned attacks on US interests skyrocket,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-counter-drone-strategy,"Fox News' Stephanie Bennett reports the latest on the unidentified drones from London.

The Pentagon unveiled a new counter-drone strategy after a spate of incursions near U.S. bases prompted concerns over a lack of an action plan for the increasing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Though much of the strategy remains classified, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will implement a new counter-drone office within the Pentagon - Joint Counter-Small UAS Office - and a new Warfighter Senior Integration Group, according to a new memo.

The Pentagon will also begin work on a second Replicator initiative, but it will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to fund this plan. The first Replicator initiative worked to field inexpensive, dispensable drones to thwart drone attacks by adversarial groups across the Middle East and elsewhere.

The memo warned that the increased use of unmanned systems must reshape U.S. tactics, as they make it easier for adversaries to ""surveil, disrupt and attack our forces ... potentially without attribution.""

US SCRAMBLES AS DRONES SHAPE THE LANDSCAPE OF WAR: 'THE FUTURE IS HERE'

The plan outlines a five-pronged approach: deepening understanding of enemy drones, launching offensive campaigns to thwart their ability to build such systems, improving ""active and passive"" defenses to such attacks, rapid increase of production of counter-drone systems and making counter-drone focus a top priority for future force development.

For the past year, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been using small, one-way unmanned aerial systems to strike western shipping routes in the Red Sea.

That has led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

Some experts have deemed the U.S. response inadequate in deterring the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

Additionally, the cost of U.S. response to such attacks is disproportionate. While the Houthi drones are estimated to cost around $2,000 each, the naval missiles the U.S. fires back can run around $2 million a shot.

In September, Houthis took out two U.S. Reaper drones in a week, machinery that costs around $30 million a piece.

Deadly drone strikes have also been launched by both sides in Russia's war on Ukraine.

""Unmanned systems pose both an urgent and enduring threat to U.S. personnel, facilities, and assets overseas,"" the Pentagon said in a statement on Thursday announcing the strategy.

""By producing a singular Strategy for Countering Unmanned Systems, the Secretary and the Department are orienting around a common understanding of the challenge and a shared approach to addressing it.""

Three U.S. service members were killed in a drone strike in January in Jordan. Experts warned the U.S. lacks a clear counter-drone procedure after 17 unmanned vehicles traipsed into restricted airspace over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last December.

IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS

The mystery drones swarmed for more than two weeks. Lack of a standard protocol for such incursions left Langley officials unsure of what to do - other than allow the 20-foot-long drones to hover near their classified facilities.

Langley is home to some of the nation's most vital top secret facilities and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters.

Two months prior to Langley, in October 2023, five drones flew over the Energy Department's Nevada National Security Site, used for nuclear weapons experiments. U.S. authorities were not sure who was behind those drones either.

shipping routes,eBRIDGE Final Event: Last-mile rail and road digitization project results,American Journal of Transportation magazine,https://www.ajot.com/news/ebridge-final-event-last-mile-rail-and-road-digitization-project-results,"The progress in the digitalization of port area management, a cornerstone for improving operational capacity and the sustainability of last-mile infrastructure, was the focus of the final event of the eBRIDGE project (Emergency and BRoad Information Development for the ports of Genoa), held on December 6, 2024 at the Sala del Capitano in Palazzo San Giorgio, headquarters of the Western Ligurian Sea Port Authority.

Coordinated by MIT and promoted by AdSP, Digitalog, CIRCLE Spa, HUB Telematica, and Connect, with the participation of RAM Spa, terminal operators, inland terminals, MTOs, and other port system stakeholders such as RFI, the eBRIDGE project has a total value of approximately 12 million euros, 50% of which is funded through Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funds. The primary goal is to enhance both the physical and digital last- mile infrastructure accessing the ports of Genoa and Savona-Vado by fostering intermodality and digitalization -- key components in creating an integrated, digital, and sustainable ecosystem that interacts with inland areas and other strategic nodes of the North Sea - Rhine - Mediterranean European Corridor. This corridor positions the Ports of Genoa as the natural gateway for Europe to maritime traffic traversing the Mediterranean, including both long-haul and Short Sea Shipping routes.

The eBRIDGE project's architecture emphasizes strong integration among interventions to be developed by the various public and private components of the port system, focusing on road and rail cycles.

During the event, experts, public authorities, and industry stakeholders presented the project's outcomes, highlighting interoperability models and the benefits achieved through digital tools for managing last-mile road and rail logistics in ports.

Key topics included progress in advanced digitalization for port area management, a fundamental pillar for enhancing operational capacity and infrastructure sustainability. Digital modules and advanced tools for last-mile management in ports were presented, promising to strengthen intermodality and streamline operations connecting with land networks. Additionally, an advanced digital gateway system for ports was showcased, designed to improve information flow and optimize cargo entry and exit procedures.

A focus was placed on the benefits generated by digitalization for the port logistics

system, analyzing positive impacts on efficiency, sustainability, and competitiveness. Other significant themes included European digitalization initiatives, the new Italian National Logistics Platform, and the FVS ELODIE project, launched in 2022 to digitize processes and data exchange in Italian inland terminals. The event also addressed cloud infrastructure and data security within the framework of the National Strategic Pole (PSN), emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity and NIS2 compliance.

The final event of the eBRIDGE project was organized in collaboration with Circle Group, specializing in the analysis and development of innovative products for digitalization in the port and intermodal logistics sectors and providing international consultancy on Green Deal and energy transition topics.

""eBRIDGE - stated Paolo Piacenza, Secretary General of AdSP, - ""is part of a broader program to finance interventions in the macro-regional logistics area, including improving dematerialized data and document management. It integrates with recent digitalization activities at port gates currently being implemented by the Port Community and the broader plan to enhance the accessibility of the port system, including the Terzo Valico, the Genoa rail node, the new breakwaters in Genoa and Savona, and interventions in port road systems.""

Luca Abatello, CEO di Circle Group, commented: ""The eBRIDGE project represents a significant opportunity for concrete experimentation with innovations transforming the port sector and for sharing cutting-edge technological solutions. It consolidates the role of the Ports of Genoa as a hub of excellence for logistics and digitalization, with a particular focus on the rail last mile. We are proud to be part of this project and to collaborate on Digital Twin, Simulation, and Shunting Optimization themes, contributing tangible and immediate tools to address the current complexities of rail infrastructure. These immaterial infrastructures aim to deliver better results in terms of sustainability and efficiency, aligned with the strategic plan 'Connect 4 Agile Growth'.""

Daniela Savini of HUB Telematica, declared: ""The creation of communication channels, both in road and rail transport, between the port, interports, retroports and logistics nodes is an important achievement. This result enhances and builds on the vast documentary heritage developed by Genoa's port telematics system over twenty years of activity"".",,,,N/A,N/A,"Savona, Palazzo San Giorgio, Genoa, Digitalog"
shipping routes,Container Terminal Sets Record For Efficiency,Hellenic Shipping News,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/container-terminal-sets-record-for-efficiency/,"The automated container terminal at Qingdao Port, a subsidiary of Shandong Port Group, achieved an average productivity of 60.6 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per hour during an unloading task on Monday. This marks the 11th time that the terminal has set a world record for automated terminal efficiency.

As one of the key international trade gateways of the country, Qingdao Port is home to Asia's first fully automated container terminal. Since beginning operations in May 2017, the terminal has continuously broken global records, driven by the operator's ongoing efforts to enhance its capabilities.

Liu Wangyang, a manager at the terminal's operations department, said 2024 has been a year of continuous innovation. Efficiency has improved by 6 percent year-on-year, and cargo throughput has increased by 15 percent compared to the same period in 2023. These improvements enabled the terminal to surpass its previous year's total container throughput 43 days ahead of schedule.

In late November, the terminal completed an upgrade to its next-generation intelligent control system, developed in-house.

Chen Qiang, head of the terminal's software development department, highlighted the system's seven technological innovations, including twin-lift automated loading and dual-trolley heavy-load operations. ""The new system is expected to boost operational efficiency by 6.3 percent,"" said Chen.

In December 2023, the third phase of Qingdao Port's automated terminal began operations. As China's first domestically developed automated container terminal, it marked a big step forward in achieving national core competitiveness in port technology.

Following the expansion, the terminal's automated container berth now spans 2,088 meters, with 1,652 meters currently operational. Key upgrades, including large-scale implementation of home-grown automated electrical control systems, have enhanced service efficiency, said the port operator.

Qingdao Port is now the fourth-largest port globally by cargo throughput and the second-largest for foreign trade in China. It operates over 220 container shipping routes, the busiest in northern China. In the first three quarters of 2024, the port handled 23.16 million TEUs, an 8 percent year-on-year increase.

Separately, on Sunday, Qingdao Port's pulp terminal set a new global benchmark by unloading 51,676 metric tons of pulp in just 24 hours, achieving a world record for the fourth time.

shipping routes,"Estimating greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. maritime shipping: Potential benefits of a monitoring, reporting, and verification system",Hellenic Shipping News,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/estimating-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-u-s-maritime-shipping-potential-benefits-of-a-monitoring-reporting-and-verification-system/,"The maritime shipping sector plays a critical role in the U.S. economy, with maritime shipping activities estimated to generate more than $40 billion in added value in 2022.1 However, the reliance on fossil fuels for maritime transport presents environmental challenges. Ships burn fossil fuels such as heavy fuel oil, very-low sulfur fuel oil, marine gas oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) that drive climate change. The consequences of climate change -- such as coastal flooding, more intense storms, and damage to infrastructure -- impose growing economic costs on the United States, including $165 billion worth of damages in 2022 from climate- and weather- related disasters.2 To reduce the climate impacts of the marine sector, the United States has committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions from domestic and international shipping by no later than 2050.3

Despite the importance of maritime shipping, there are significant gaps in the U.S. government's estimates of GHG emissions from marine vessels. Current estimates, listed in Table 1, rely on either fuel sales data, which overlook emissions from ships that refuel outside U.S. jurisdictions, or bottom-up modeling using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data that is limited to emissions within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, leaving emissions from international voyages outside of that boundary unaccounted for.

Official U.S. estimates of maritime shipping emissions range between 32 and 45 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in recent years, but these estimates are incomplete because they do not account for GHGs emitted outside of U.S. waters.4 By contrast, the European Union has implemented a more comprehensive system for tracking maritime emissions. The EU Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system requires ships of 5,000 gross tonnage (GT) or more to report their fuel consumption and associated GHG emissions on all voyages to, from, and between ports in the European Economic Area.5 The EU MRV covered voyages responsible for approximately 137 Mt CO2e in 2022. This brief uses the International Council on Clean Transportation's (ICCT) Systematic Assessment of Vessel Emissions (SAVE) model to estimate the GHG emissions from ships that could be covered under a similar U.S. MRV program .

The United States has experience with an MRV program for aviation under the International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under this program, U.S. aircraft operators voluntarily report their emissions, and all major U.S. operators are participating.7 Unlike the EU shipping MRV data, which publicly reports ship-by-ship information, only aggregated aviation MRV data on the emissions of air transport between two countries are publicly available.8 Additionally, all domestic emissions are excluded. Nevertheless, experience with the aviation MRV program could inform the development of a U.S. MRV system for maritime shipping.

Some of the ships that would be covered by a U.S. MRV system already report to the EU MRV system, and all report to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Data Collection System (DCS). In the IMO DCS, ships 5,000 GT and above report their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for all voyages each year. Like the CORSIA MRV program, IMO DCS data are not publicly available, except for summaries of fuel consumption and emissions aggregated by ship type and size, preventing analyses of the GHG emissions of individual ships.

METHODS

VOYAGE-LEVEL EMISSIONS

ICCT's SAVE model joins AIS ship activity data from Spire with ship technical characteristics data from S&P Global to estimate fuel consumption and emissions, as shown in Figure 1.9 ICCT's SAVE model uses methods consistent with the Fourth IMO Greenhouse Gas Study.10 Emissions are reported in CO2e based on 100-year global warming potentials from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment report: 1 for CO2, 29.8 for methane, and 273 for nitrous oxide.11 The SAVE model also integrates a voyage identification module that maps the origin and destination points of a voyage to nearest ports, based on information provided by the World Port Index.12 For this analysis, a voyage was considered to be covered under the U.S. MRV if the ship was 5,000 GT or above with an origin or destination in a U.S. port. Emissions were then aggregated voyage-by-voyage for each ship. Results were differentiated by inbound, outbound, and cabotage (between two U.S. ports) voyages, as well as by ship type; in-port emissions (at-berth plus at-anchor) were reported separately, consistent with EU MRV reporting methods.

POTENTIAL REVENUES UNDER A U.S. GREENHOUSE GAS PRICING SYSTEM

In the European Union, a portion of the emissions covered by the EU MRV will be subject to GHG pricing under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The scope includes 100% of in-port emissions, 100% of emissions for voyages between two member states, and 50% of emissions on inbound or outbound (i.e., ""extra-EU"") voyages. The total amount of emissions that must be paid for under the ETS increases over time. In 2025, 40% of emissions reported in 2024 are subject to the GHG price, rising to 70% of 2025 emissions in 2026, and 100% of emissions in 2027 and onward. In this briefing, we report the range of revenues that could be generated if U.S. MRV emissions were subject to a U.S. ETS with the same scope as the EU ETS. The EU ETS carbon price is approximately $70 per tonne of CO2 as of September 2024.13 We use the U.S. EPA estimated central value of $190 per tonne of CO2 for 2020 emissions in constant 2020 dollars, or approximately $230 per tonne in September 2024.14 We assume that the CO2 price would also apply to CO2e.

RESULTS

A U.S. MRV could cover approximately 11,100 ships, based on 2022 data, of which more than 6,300 (57%) reported to the EU MRV in 2022. As shown in Figure 2, approximately 103 Mt of CO2e would have been covered by a U.S. MRV in 2022, including 43% from outbound voyages, 33% from inbound voyages, 14% from cabotage voyages, and 10% emitted in U.S. ports. This is much greater than official U.S. estimates of maritime shipping GHG emissions, which range from 32-45 Mt CO2e. Approximately 80% of covered emissions are from international voyages, and 20% from domestic.

Adding up 50% of the emissions from inbound and outbound voyages and 100% of cabotage and in-port emissions equals 64 Mt CO2e. If these emissions were subject to a GHG price ranging from $70 to $230 per tonne of CO2e, the revenues could equal between $4.5 billion to $15 billion per year.

Figure 3 shows the breakdown of emissions by ship type within each voyage type (inbound, outbound, cabotage, in-port), in addition to the share of total emissions by ship type. Container ships were responsible for the most emissions in 2022, accounting for more than 30 Mt CO2e, and were also responsible for the largest share of emissions of inbound and outbound voyages. Cruise ships were the second-highest emitting ship type, with 15 Mt CO2e of total emissions. Notably, cruise ships were the highest emitters for cabotage voyages. Tankers transporting LNG were the third-highest emitters in most voyage types (14 Mt CO2e), but the second-highest emitters for outbound voyages, reflecting U.S. exports of LNG. Together, container ships, cruise ships, and LNG tankers accounted for 58% of total emissions. Bulk carriers ranked fourth in total emissions (13 Mt CO2e) and in cabotage voyages (1.3 Mt CO2e). Other important ship types include oil tankers, which emitted 11 Mt CO2e in total, and chemical tankers, with emissions of about 10 Mt CO2e.

Figure 4 maps the distribution of CO2e emissions for voyages that would be covered by a U.S. MRV in 2022. As shown, there are higher concentrations of emissions along the California, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, and New York/New Jersey shorelines compared with other areas. California is a major container ship hub; Texas and Louisiana export oil and gas via tankers, as well as agricultural products by bulk carriers; Florida is a cruise ship hub and handles cargo; Georgia handles large amounts of container cargo, and the port of New York/New Jersey is the busiest port on the U.S. East Coast. We observe high emission intensities on voyages that connect the United States with East Asia, Europe, and South America.

MODEL VALIDATION AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

To validate our model, we used the same methodology to estimate the CO2 emissions that would be covered by the EU MRV for 2022, and we compared our estimates with emissions reported under the EU MRV for that year, as shown in Table 2. For 2022, ships reported only CO2 emissions; thus, we did not estimate CO2e emissions for this comparison. We estimated 19% fewer emissions from inbound voyages than the EU MRV, 20% lower outbound emissions, 25% higher cabotage emissions, and 45% lower in-port emissions. However, in total, we estimated that 124 Mt CO2 would be covered by the EU MRV, compared with reported emissions of 137 Mt CO2, a difference of about 10%.15 While there are some inconsistencies in the split of emissions among the three voyage types, the total emissions compare reasonably well. It is likely that some of the cabotage emissions should instead be categorized as from inbound or outbound voyages. For example, we noticed that in some cases the voyage identification algorithm codes a voyage as a round-trip cabotage voyage when it should be an outbound voyage followed by an inbound voyage. Future work can improve the split across the categories.

CONCLUSIONS

We estimate that a U.S. MRV would cover 103 Mt of CO2e from ships on voyages to, from, or between U.S. ports in 2022. Our estimates are much larger than official U.S. estimates of maritime emissions of 32-45 Mt CO2e because we included emissions from voyages that occurred outside of U.S. waters. Approximately 80% of U.S. MRV emissions are from international voyages, while the remaining 20% are from domestic. Emission concentrations occur along the coasts, near major port cities, and along key international shipping routes. The data also reveal that container ships, cruise ships, and LNG tankers together account for 58% of total emissions.

If the United States levied a fee on 50% of international voyage emissions and 100% of cabotage and in-port emissions, it could generate between $4.5 billion and $15 billion annually, depending on the GHG price.

Implementing a U.S. MRV program would address several crucial needs. Such a system would fill data gaps in current maritime emissions estimates, align U.S. practices with the European Union, which has already established an MRV program, and set a precedent for other nations considering similar initiatives. Furthermore, it would enable the United States to effectively monitor progress toward both domestic and international climate objectives, including the ambitious target of achieving net-zero GHG emissions from maritime shipping by 2050. Given that more than half of ships that would have reported to a U.S. MRV program in 2022 were already reporting to the EU MRV the same year, compliance with a U.S. MRV program should be manageable for shipowners.

Ammonia is another strong contender as a zero-carbon fuel for shipping, although it presents its own set of technical challenges. Unlike hydrogen, ammonia has a relatively low combustibility and slow flame propagation, making it challenging to achieve complete combustion in marine engines. Accelleron's turbochargers can be adjusted to deliver boost pressures according to combustion requirements, ensuring an optimal air supply for both diesel and Otto cycles.

Furthermore, ammonia combustion generates nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are regulated due to their harmful environmental impact. However, enginemakers can apply SCR technology, which injects a reducing agent like urea into the exhaust stream, converting NOx into harmless nitrogen and water vapour. The combination of calibrated turbocharging pressure and SCR supports ship operators in enabling the use of ammonia as a scalable low-emissions shipping fuel that could significantly accelerate progress towards meeting IMO's ambitious emissions targets.

""Ammonia is corrosive to copper alloys""

Christoph Rofka, president of the Medium- and Low-Speed Division at Accelleron, notes: ""Ammonia is corrosive to copper alloys. So, Accelleron conducted rigorous material tests. None of the tested materials showed a risk of a critical corrosion rate."" Mr Rofka adds: ""To ensure safety and peak operation, turbochargers of forerunner engines operating with ammonia as a fuel are also inspected periodically for possible impact from combustion products and unburned fuel.""

Ammonia's chief selling point is its scalability. Since safe ammonia production, storage, and distribution methods have already been well established for other industries, like agriculture, ammonia is likely to be the easiest carbon-neutral fuel to produce and use at scale. This is reflected in an increasing preference for ammonia, as ship makers place orders for a second wave of new ships designed to run on alternative fuels.

Cleaner combustion

Among alternative fuels, hydrogen theoretically offers one of the most promising solutions for zero-carbon operations when produced sustainably. However, in practice, it brings additional, unique challenges, due to its extremely low energy density per unit volume. This limitation means that turbochargers must operate at much higher-pressure ratios to provide adequate power output, especially important for long-distance marine voyages where energy efficiency is paramount. Accelleron's turbocharger technology is designed to address these high-pressure demands, enabling efficient operations while supporting precise control over the air-to-fuel ratio.

This control is crucial because hydrogen combustion requires a delicate balance to avoid hotspots, which could lead to pre-ignition and subsequent wear on engine components. By allowing for this precise management, Accelleron's turbochargers play a vital role in making hydrogen a viable fuel for maritime use.

Onboard storage is another major hurdle in practical sailing applications, and solutions for lowering the gas temperature to compress it enough to fit into a reasonable tank size are expensive and not yet proven.

However, since green hydrogen is the foundation for both green methanol and ammonia production, whether it is used as an operational fuel on its own or not, it will be vital to scale up its production over the next decades, to support the scale-up of methanol and ammonia.

Mr Rofka stresses that efficiency and flexibility are key for the practical application of any carbon-neutral fuel. Since carbon-neutral fuel supplies will continue to be limited and expensive for an indefinite number of years, efficiency will be critically important to making limited quantities more affordable for marine operators, helping the industry to move closer to IMO's zero-emission goals.

Biofuels add another layer of complexity. Their combustion properties vary based on the feedstock used; for instance, biofuels from waste products may differ in ignition characteristics compared to other biofuels. Accelleron's flexible turbocharger systems allow operators to adjust to these variations, ensuring efficient and consistent performance regardless of biofuel composition.

""Methanol presents challenges because of its lower energy density""

Mr Rofka points out that the global availability of biofuels is extremely limited. There is not enough biofuel potential in the world to support global shipping. So, it is generally not considered a viable fuel for long-haul shipping routes. It may be considered as a pilot fuel, in combination with another more scalable carbon-neutral fuel as the main propulsion fuel, to arrive at a 100% emissions-free voyage.

Flexibility in a multi-fuel future

One of Accelleron's most impactful contributions to maritime decarbonisation is its commitment to flexibility in turbocharger design. During this transitional period in which multiple fuel types coexist, turbocharging flexibility ensures propulsion systems can perform optimally on any fuel, without the need for major system overhauls.

Accelleron's next-generation turbochargers in the ACCX300-L series exemplify that principle, deploying a cartridge concept that allows the rotary elements of the turbocharger to be removed, as a whole cartridge or individually, and replaced at any port, no drydocking required. This will make maintenance more flexible and cost-efficient, allowing components to be replaced only as needed, independent of a rigid drydock schedule.

In addition, turbochargers have been tested and proven safe, robust, and efficient across the full range of conventional, transitional, and future carbon-neutral fuels. So, a dual-fuel vessel running primarily on LNG today can be converted to methanol or ammonia in the future using the same turbocharger platform.

That means that ship operators are not locked into a single fuel type, a crucial advantage as fuel infrastructure and availability evolve over time. and ship operators increasingly adopt alternative fuels based on both regulatory requirements and market availability.

Digital integration

Beyond hardware innovations, Accelleron is revolutionising marine propulsion through digital integration. The company's Tekomar XPERT software represents a major advancement in this area, providing a digital platform that enables ship operators to monitor turbocharger and engine performance in real time. By utilising AI and machine learning, Tekomar XPERT analyses a range of turbocharging and engine parameters, providing actionable insights that enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. This capability is particularly valuable for alternative fuels, where combustion properties can vary significantly.

Mr Rofka explains: ""Accelleron's Tekomar XPERT solutions address engines, hulls and propellers, and emissions. The engine module provides real-time information to the operator on engine performance, including insights to help optimise the engine for higher efficiency, resulting in fuel and CO2 savings.""

Mr Rofka continues: ""Our Smartly Enabled Services also use operational data from turbochargers and engines to help individually optimise turbocharger maintenance, performance, and customer experience. Synthesising operational data with our 100 years of engineering expertise allows us to offer precise and in-depth insights, so that we can warn ship operators of potential issues and provide condition-based operational recommendations.""

Accelleron's broad digital portfolio also includes emissions reporting, CII forecasting, voyage optimisation, and charter process support, from pre-voyage estimates to post-voyage claims, to support fleet compliance with environmental regulations. By providing real-time insights into fuel efficiency and emissions, the software enables operators to adjust for individual vessels and entire fleets, ensuring they remain within strict energy and emissions regulatory limits, for example those under the European Union Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime. As these stepwise regulations become more stringent over time, digital tools will become increasingly useful to avoiding carbon excesses and fines.

shipping routes,"Somalia: Somali Pirates Hijack Chinese Fishing Boat, Demand Ransom for Crew's Release",allAfrica,https://allafrica.com/stories/202412090026.html,"Somali pirates have hijacked a Chinese fishing boat and taken its 18 crew members hostage, demanding a ransom for their release, local officials reported on Saturday.

The pirates, who had initially been hired to provide protection for the vessel, later turned on the crew, reinforcing their numbers with additional pirates.

It remains unclear when the ship was seized, but the European Union's anti-piracy force, Atalanta, raised alarm over the incident on Thursday. Mohamed Dini, a police officer from Eyl, a known pirate stronghold on Puntland's east coast, confirmed the hijacking and stated that the pirates were moving the vessel in search of a safe haven.

""The pirates are moving the ship off the coast ... they are looking for a safe haven,"" Dini said.

Ali Warsame, a local elder, shared that a Somali company acting on behalf of the boat's owners had offered a ransom of $300,000. However, the pirates rejected the offer, holding firm on their demand. Local fishermen reported seeing the hijacked boat near Eyl on Friday, but the pirates retreated into the sea to avoid detection by Puntland's coastguards.

Despite this, the pirates feared moving further into the ocean due to the presence of foreign military ships monitoring the area.

The European Union's Atalanta force, which is responsible for anti-piracy operations in the region, confirmed that the incident is being treated as an ""armed robbery at sea"" but reassured that the crew was unharmed.

This hijacking is part of a troubling rise in Somali piracy after several years of relative calm. In March, Somali pirates also hijacked a Bangladeshi cargo ship, demanding a hefty ransom for its release.

Experts believe these incidents highlight a resurgence of piracy in the Indian Ocean, as pirates exploit a security gap following the drawdown of international naval forces in the region.

As Somali piracy regains momentum, global concern grows about the safety of maritime shipping routes and the stability of the region.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Puntland, Atalanta"

supply chain risk,AUVSI announce Green UAS certification for four fliers.,sUAS News - The Business of Drones,https://www.suasnews.com/2024/12/auvsi-announce-green-uas-certification-for-four-fliers/,"The Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) today announced that it has granted Green UAS certification to four new uncrewed aerial system (UAS) platforms: Ascent AeroSystems' Spirit, AgEagle's Ebee Tac, and Inspired Flight's IF1200A and IF800 Tomcat. The certifications expand the Green approved list to better meet operational needs for public safety, critical infrastructure, and mapping and survey.

The Green UAS certification process included a review of the platforms' product and device security, including all components and subcomponents, and enrolls them in the program's continual monitoring of supply chain risk management.

""The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) supports all efforts to raise the overall standard of industry verification. AUVSI's Green UAS initiative provides certainty as to NDAA compliance and a cyber security standard.  AUVSI's framework for cybersecurity and NDAA supply chain compliance is modeled on DIU's approach to Blue UAS,"" said David Michelson, Director of DIU's Autonomy Portfolio. ""The goal of DIU's Blue UAS refresh is to ensure the Blue UAS list is a current, robust roster of policy approved commercial UAS which suit the diverse needs of DoD users. DIU works closely with AUVSI, whose Green UAS certification builds upon Blue UAS to serve the commercial and non-defense drone industry. I am enthusiastic to see an industry led program like Green UAS that can give the same level of trust to the commercial sector.""

Casie Ocaña, Director, Trusted Programs at AUVSI said: ""Green UAS certification ensures that non-DOD federal, state, and local agencies and other security-sensitive technology users can continue to access secure, NDAA-compliant drone technology. These additions maintain robust procurement options open while giving agencies the confidence to deploy drones for critical missions. AUVSI and the secure drone industry is committed to meeting the highest standards of supply chain- and cyber-security.""

Ascent AeroSystems cofounder and CEO Peter Fuchs said: ""We are pleased to add Green UAS to the Spirit's certification pedigree. As the only aircraft-grade UAV in its class, the Spirit's compact, all-weather, coaxial configuration has delivered unmatched operational availability to commercial operators and local, state and federal agencies since 2020. This new certification is further demonstration of our commitment to the manufacturing, cybersecurity, and performance excellence that enables our customers to perform critical missions wherever, and whenever required.""

AgEagle Aerial Systems CEO Bill Irby said: ""We are honored to be a company engaged with AUVSI and to work with the association through the Green UAS certification process. The value added to the community through this process is evident.""

Inspired Flight CEO Rick Stollmeyer said: ""Inspired Flight is pleased to embrace AUVSI's Green UAS program, which provides an important certification of NDAA compliance and security.""

In June 2024, AUVSI published a memo outlining procurement guidance and recommendations for federal government agencies; state, local, and tribal government agencies; public safety agencies; and private industry conducting sensitive missions using drones. In April 2024, AUVSI and DIU signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to create a process for drone component manufacturers holding Green UAS certification to share their data directly with DIU.",,,,N/A,N/A,DoD

supply chain risk,"2025 Software Manufacturing Predictions: SBOMs, Regulations, and More",Security Boulevard,https://securityboulevard.com/2024/12/2025-software-manufacturing-predictions-sboms-regulations-and-more/,"As we head into 2025, experts weigh in on trends affecting software products in the medical, vehicle, and energy sectors. They also talk about manufacturer readiness for the EU Cyber Resilience Act, and other legislation coming their way. Below, we've broken out predictions based on the sectors.

Medical Sector

Predictions by Melissa Rhodes, SBOM Program Manager, Medtronic Product Security Office

Yes, you read that right. Melissa Rhodes is SBOM program manager working in the product security office. A search didn't turn up statistics on the prevalence of this new role, but Melissa's role signals the normalization of SBOM compliance in global manufacturers, at least in the critical medical sector. To that end, she makes the following two predictions related to SBOM attributes and vulnerability matching data:

More consistent SBOM attributes: ""The attributes declared in SBOMs to uniquely identify software components will become more consistent over the next year for a couple of reasons,"" Rose notes. ""The first reason is that the third edition of the Framing SBOM Component Transparency publication was published in September and can assist creators with identifying consistent component attributes. The second reason is the growing need for SBOM data to move between tools for different aspects of risk assessment, which will necessitate that vendors focus on making SBOM data more consistent to ensure tooling interoperability.

More effective methods for matching vulnerability data: Rhodes also predicts that FDA and other regulations and guidance will improve matching methods for vulnerability data. In her words, she explains, ""With the FDA's cybersecurity guidance and the recently published MITRE report about normalization challenges for SBOM data, the healthcare industry will push for a more effective method for matching vulnerabilities to software components than what is currently available. Without effective matching methods, software components could be listed in SBOMs but then not provide the vulnerability information needed to monitor medical devices to keep them safe and secure.""

Darwin Sanoy from GitLab predicts that regulatory requirements, particularly with regard to cyber-physical devices in the critical transportation sector, will tighten up, especially in Europe, where manufacturers are still trying to catch up with ISO 26262 functional safety standards.

Regulations go beyond functional safety: ""Functional safety is about ensuring that anything with embedded software where there's a risk of harming humans, that there's substantial work done to protect humans. Now manufacturers have to comply with UN 155 [a new regulation developed by the United Nations that came into full force in July 2024], which is focused around cybersecurity and cybersecurity management related to connected vehicles of any kind. This was related to a famous hack into a car through a tire pressure monitor.""

More pressure on supply chain: Sanoy describes the automotive industry supply chain as a massive conglomeration of subassemblies, all with many with electronic many and software features. ""Even an airbag has some electronics in it, and this is just one of many parts shipped to multiple manufacturers who install them in their vehicles. Everyone along the supply chain has a duty of care to make sure what they build also follows cybersecurity standards and regulations around the globe.""

Driving demand for automation across the SDLC: These and other issues will drive demand for integrated, automated development platforms, adds Sanoy. ""It will be increasingly important to implement platforms that manage all the intrinsic cognitive load of software security and compliance from day one. Core developers for embedded systems, especially for transportation, have more cognitive load without having to learn how to manage the software factory. That part needs to be automated.""

Consumer Embedded Systems

Prediction by Joel Krooswyk, also a field CTO at GitLab.

When it comes to consumer electronics, Jel Krooswyk of GitLab points to the EU Cyber Resilience Act (still in draft form), which doesn't apply to vehicles and other well-regulated manufacturing, but will apply to 26 types of embedded systems such as phones and smart home devices.

Manufacturers not ready for the EU CRA: ""I suspect that a large percentage of vendors who utilize embedded systems may not be ready for automated compliance with CRA. Some vendors can manually assemble a SBOM or run static analysis scans on code today, though others cannot,"" Krooswyk explains. ""Securing code and quantifying inclusions regularly in the software development process will be an automation challenge for many more. Without automation, CRA compliance will be notably more difficult for any vendor selling into the EU.""

Memory safety vulnerabilities in C and C++ over burdens manufacturers: Krooswyk also brings up the issue of memory safety, adding that 70 percent of all critical vulnerabilities come from memory unsafe code, and nearly four-fifths of embedded code is based in C (which is memory unsafe). ""Will any additional scrutiny be given to C-based systems, which have been proven to be more vulnerable over time?"" he asks. ""This could potentially generate a new, sizable burden on embedded manufacturers as they consider refactoring their code bases.""

Energy Sector (and continued viability of CISA)

Predictions by Dick Brooks, Co-founder and Lead Software Engineer at Business Cyber Guardian

Energy supply chain risk management will improve: Dick Brooks, who spoke with us recently about the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA's) Secure by Default drive, predicts that the energy industry will update Supply Chain Risk Management practices following NIST Guidance to better protect the electric grid from software supply chain risks. He points to FERC in Docket RM24-4-000 identifying the NIST Guidance most likely to impact the energy industry. As a result, he thinks the energy industry will adopt more of the actual NIST language in whatever is produced in a final form.

CISA's continued role in secure-by-design: And, having been active in CISA's SBOM and software supply chain efforts for decades, Brooks doesn't think that the agency's role in critical infrastructure protection will diminish under a new presidential administration. If anything, support for CISA's mission is likely to grow. ""The new administration will continue to support strong cybersecurity practices with South Dakota entities taking a more active role in implementing radical transparency and secure-by-design best practices to protect consumers from harm.""

Personally, Brooks is directly lobbying to keep CISA's National Risk Management Center funded, and he cites how hard it would be to slow the spectacular momentum of the agency. ""Secure by default and design seems to have caught on! It's now part of the EU CRA Annex I; SBOM is being implemented broadly, so I doubt we will see these go away. Everyone needs to be rowing together to achieve success, following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and CISA Guidelines.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"Docket, South Dakota, CISA"

According to the Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Sichuan Silence is a Chengdu-based cybersecurity government contractor that provides products and services to core clients, such as China's intelligence services.

OFAC says the zero-day used in the April 2020 campaign was discovered by security researcher and Sichuan Silence employee Guan Tianfeng (also known as GbigMao) in an unnamed firewall product.

According to the Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Sichuan Silence is a Chengdu-based cybersecurity government contractor (recently profiled by the Natto Thoughts team) that provides products and services to core clients, such as China's intelligence services.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) also unsealed an indictment on Guan, and the US State Department announced a reward offer of up to $10 million for information about Sichuan Silence or Guan through its Rewards for Justice program.

The Department of State and the DOJ confirmed that the April 2020 Ragnarok ransomware campaign exploited a zero-day SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-12271) in Sophos XG firewalls.

The attackers initially used zero-day exploits to obtain remote code execution on Sophos XG firewalls and installed ELF binaries and scripts as part of a malicious toolkit known as Asnarök Trojan.

After Sophos detected the attacks, it patched the devices and removed the malicious scripts using a hotfix. However, the threat actors activated a 'dead man switch' that would have triggered a Ragnarok ransomware attack on Windows machines on the victims' networks.

As a result of the sanctions, US organizations and citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with Guan and Sichuan Silence. Also, any U.S.-based assets tied to them will be frozen, and U.S. financial institutions or foreign entities transacting with them will also expose themselves to penalties.

The zero-day seeing exploitation involves CVE-2024-49138, a security weakness in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver, which applications use to write transaction logs -- that could let an authenticated attacker gain ""system""-level.

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities accounted for 29% of the 1,009 security bugs Microsoft has patched so far in 2024, according to a year-end tally by Tenable; nearly 40 percent of those bugs were weaknesses that could let attackers run malicious code on the vulnerable device.

Tyler Reguly at the security firm Fortra had a slightly different 2024 patch tally for Microsoft, at 1,088 vulnerabilities, which he said was surprisingly similar to the 1,063 vulnerabilities resolved in 2023 and the 1,119 vulnerabilities resolved in 2022. (Brian Krebs / Krebs on Security)

The videos, produced by Russia's Social Design Agency (SDA), which targeted European audiences, attacked Ukrainian politicians as corrupt or questioned the usefulness of military aid to Ukraine, among other themes. For example, one video touted that ""even jammers can't save American Abrams tanks,"" referring to devices used by US tanks to deflect incoming missiles, reinforcing the point that sending high-tech armor to Ukraine is pointless.

The report states that the video creators ""very likely"" used voice-generated AI, including ElevenLabs tech, to make their content appear more legitimate. To verify this, Recorded Future's researchers submitted the clips to ElevenLabs' AI Speech Classifier, which allows anyone to ""detect whether an audio clip was created using ElevenLabs"" and got a match.

Starting with the AMD Epyc 7003 processor, a feature known as SEV-SNP, short for Secure Encrypted Virtualization and Secure Nested Paging, has provided the cryptographic means for certifying that a VM hasn't been compromised by any backdoor installed by someone with access to the physical machine running it.

If a VM has been backdoored, the cryptographic attestation will fail, and the VM admin will be immediately alerted of the compromise. Or at least that's how SEV-SNP is designed to work.

BadRAM is an attack that a server admin can carry out in minutes, using either about $10 of hardware or, in some cases, software only, to cause DDR4 or DDR5 memory modules to misreport the memory capacity they have during bootup. From then on, SEV-SNP will be permanently made to suppress the cryptographic hash, attesting to its integrity even when the VM has been badly compromised. (Dan Goodin / Ars Technica)

NetRise says 7.9% of vulnerabilities encountered by the cybersecurity firm were over five years old, while 4.2% of vulnerabilities deemed 'Critical' or 'High' were additionally classified as 'weaponized' and actively exploited in real-world attacks.

NetRise utilized an advanced Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) approach, generating detailed SBOMs for 70 randomly selected container images from Docker Hub's most downloaded repositories. This method enabled the firm to identify all software components within each container, including third-party libraries and dependencies.

The study's risk assessment evaluated known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and non-CVE risks, such as outdated components and misconfigurations. Vulnerability prioritization was carried out using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rankings, focusing on weaponized vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in the wild.

WICHITA, Kan., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE: UAVS) a leading provider of best-in-class unmanned aerial systems (UAS), sensors and software solutions for customers worldwide in the commercial and government verticals, announces it has been granted Green UAS certification from the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of uncrewed systems, autonomy, and robotics.

Green UAS is an expanded framework for certification built off the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)'s Blue UAS certification program but designed for non-defense and commercial companies looking to verify their compliance with cybersecurity and supply chain standards.

supply chain risk,Stellantis and Zeta Energy announce agreement to develop Lithium-Sulfur EV batteries,Telematics Wire,https://www.telematicswire.net/stellantis-and-zeta-energy-announce-agreement-to-develop-lithium-sulfur-ev-batteries/,"The partnership aims to develop lithium-sulfur EV batteries with game-changing gravimetric energy density while achieving a volumetric energy density comparable to today's lithium-ion technology.

Stellantis N.V. and Zeta Energy Corp. announced a joint development agreement aimed at advancing battery cell technology for electric vehicle applications. The partnership aims to develop lithium-sulfur EV batteries with game-changing gravimetric energy density while achieving a volumetric energy density comparable to today's lithium-ion technology.

For customers, this means potentially a significantly lighter battery pack with the same usable energy as contemporary lithium-ion batteries, enabling greater range, improved handling and enhanced performance. Additionally, the technology has the potential to improve fast-charging speed by up to 50%, making EV ownership even more convenient. Lithium-sulfur batteries are expected to cost less than half the price per kWh of current lithium-ion batteries.

""Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,"" said Ned Curic, Stellantis Chief Engineering and Technology Officer. ""Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis' commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.""

""We are very excited to be working with Stellantis on this project,"" said Tom Pilette, CEO of Zeta Energy. ""The combination of Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur battery technology with Stellantis' unrivaled expertise in innovation, global manufacturing and distribution can dramatically improve the performance and cost profile of electric vehicles while increasing the supply chain resiliency for batteries and EVs.""

The batteries will be produced using waste materials and methane, with significantly lower CO emissions than any existing battery technology. Zeta Energy battery technology is intended to be manufacturable within existing gigafactory technology and would leverage a short, entirely domestic supply chain in Europe or North America.

The collaboration includes both pre-production development and planning for future production. Upon completion of the project, the batteries are targeted to power Stellantis electric vehicles by 2030.

Lithium-sulfur battery technology delivers higher performance at a lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur, being widely available and cost-effective, reduces both production expenses and supply-chain risk. Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur batteries utilize waste materials, methane and unrefined sulfur, a byproduct from various industries, and do not require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel.

Developing high-performing and affordable EVs is a key pillar of Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, which includes offering more than 75 battery electric vehicle models. Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies.

This year, our strategic foresight, operational excellence, and commitment to transparency led to outstanding results, marked by consistent inflows, robust market positioning and unparalleled performance metrics.

2024: A Year of Breakthroughs

The numbers speak volumes. In 2024, we generated $34,709,091.00 in total inflows, reaffirming the trust of our lending partners while demonstrating resilience in a challenging market. These achievements represent more than figures-they embody the trust, opportunity, and execution that define Avanza Capital.

2024 Key Highlights

Total Inflows: $34,709,09.00, showcasing steady growth and strong lender confidence.

Portfolio Diversification: A risk-adjusted strategy allowed us to thrive despite market volatility.

Operational Efficiency: Enhanced underwriting and cutting-edge technology streamlined deal execution.

lender Returns: Delivered 20% annualized returns with monthly distributions of principal and interest, underscoring our focus on consistent and superior performance.

Avanza Capital Outperforms Major Indices Over the Last 12 Months

As we reflect on the past 12 months, we're thrilled to share how Avanza Capital Holdings has consistently delivered exceptional results for our lending partners. While navigating a complex and ever-evolving financial landscape, we've achieved 20% annualized returns, significantly outperforming major market indices.

Let's take a look at how we compare:

Avanza Capital Holdings: +20% annualized return

S&P 500 Index: +9.4%

Dow Jones Industrial Average: +6.9%

Nasdaq Composite: +15.2%

Gold (XAU/USD): +6.3%

10-Year Treasury Yield: +4.5%

Bank CDs: +3.0%

What Sets Us Apart?

This level of performance didn't happen by accident-it's the result of disciplined execution, strategic foresight, and a relentless focus on creating value for our partners. Here's what drives our outperformance:

StrategicDiversification

Our ability to identify and underwrite high-quality lending opportunities has positioned us as a leader in the private credit space. By leveraging non-traditional banking solutions like merchant cash advances and the purchase of future receivables, we've built a diversified portfolio designed to deliver steady, risk-adjusted returns.

Agile Capital Deployment

With our proven underwriting processes and the expertise of our legal team, we ensure that every dollar of capital is deployed strategically, providing both stability and growth potential for our lenders.

Consistent Monthly Returns

While traditional capital allocations often come with volatility, we offer predictable monthly payouts of both principal and interest. This reliability has become one of the hallmarks of our platform, helping our partners enjoy steady income streams, regardless of broader market conditions.

Thriving Amid Rising Rates

As interest rates rise and traditional banks tighten their lending criteria, Avanza's flexible, non-bank model allows us to meet the growing demand for alternative capital. This adaptability has been a key factor in driving our success.

Why Choose Avanza?

While traditional indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have performed well, they can't match the stability and risk adversity offered by Avanza Capital Holdings. Our 20% annualized returns provide more than just financial growth-they represent the confidence our partners have in our ability to execute on a winning strategy.

Unlike equities or commodities, Avanza's model offers:

Non-correlated performance to traditional markets

Monthly distributions that prioritize liquidity

Risk-mitigated strategies guided by a team of experts

Managing Systematic and Unsystematic Risk at Avanza Capital Holdings

At Avanza Capital Holdings, risk management isn't a buzzword - it's a core pillar of our strategy. We understand that all lending decisions are subject to two critical categories of risk: systematic risk and unsystematic risk. While systematic risk impacts the broader financial system, unsystematic risk is specific to individual borrowers, sectors, or deals. Here's how we manage both to ensure stability and protect our lending partners.

Systematic Risk: Navigating Market-Wide Volatility

Systematic risk refers to macroeconomic and financial market factors that impact all businesses and capital allocations. Examples include interest rate hikes, inflation, regulatory changes, and economic slowdowns. While systematic risk is unavoidable, it can be mitigated. Here's how Avanza Capital takes control.

Our Approach to Managing Systematic Risk:

Portfolio Diversification Across Borrowers, Sectors, and States

Our exposure isn't limited to one sector or one type of borrower. By funding businesses in 48 states and diversifying across multiple industries, Avanza ensures that broader economic shocks don't affect every part of our portfolio at once. When one sector experiences a downturn, others may remain stable or thrive.

Interest Rate Protection

Unlike most lenders that are directly affected by rising rates, our returns are structured at a fixed 20% annual rate. This ensures consistent returns for our lending partners, regardless of how interest rates move. The broader market can experience higher costs of borrowing, but at Avanza, our partners see no disruption in their returns.

Regulatory Readiness

As regulations evolve, such as with Basel III Endgame, we take a proactive approach. Our external legal counsel - one of America's Top 50 securities attorneys - ensures that our operations remain compliant and forward-thinking. Instead of reacting to change, we position ourselves to take advantage of it.

Risk-Adjusted Yield Management

While market rates may change, our capital allocations remain steady. With the ability to provide liquidity through monthly payouts, Avanza has the flexibility to make strategic shifts when necessary, all while protecting our partners' returns.

Liquidity for Lenders

Unlike other alternative capital initiatives that impose multi-year lockups, Avanza offers monthly liquidity. Lenders have the flexibility to compound in certain scenarios, redeploy returns, while receiving monthly distributions of principal and interest, which adds an additional layer of protection during market downturns.

Bottom Line:

We cannot eliminate systematic risk, but we can mitigate its impact. By diversifying sectors, controlling exposure, and leveraging fixed-rate returns, Avanza provides lending partners with a sense of security - no matter what's happening in the global economy.

Unsystematic Risk: Controlling the Controllable

Unsystematic risk refers to deal-specific risk - the unique risks tied to a borrower, a specific loan, or an individual sector. While systematic risk impacts the broader market, unsystematic risk can be managed more directly. Our proactive measures include the following:

Our Approach to Managing Unsystematic Risk:

Rigorous Underwriting Process

Every loan that we deploy capital into undergoes one of the most stringent underwriting processes in the industry. Our proprietary system ensures that every deal is scrutinized and backed by:

Collateral: Tangible, real assets secure every loan.

Promissory Notes: Borrowers are contractually obligated to repay.

Comprehensive Loan Agreements: These agreements, reviewed by top-tier legal counsel, ensure we have the legal framework to protect lender capital.

The Role of Lender Portal Pro

Launched under the leadership of Managing Partner Anthony DeBenedictis, Lender Portal Pro provides our accredited lenders with a real-time window into every aspect of their capital allocations. Partners can track loan performance, borrower repayments, contributions, distributions dates, amounts, compounded interest, waterfall structures, and other key metrics, offering complete transparency. This visibility is a powerful tool for reducing risk perception and enhancing decision-making.

Strategic Loan Sizing

No single borrower, sector, or loan controls a disproportionate share of our total loan book. This method ensures that if one loan faces challenges, it has no material impact on the entire portfolio. By keeping loans diversified and manageable, we never put all our eggs in one basket.

Legal Oversight On EveryTransaction

Our award-winning legal team ensures every deal is airtight. From loan agreements to collateral arrangements, our legal team provides rigorous oversight, ensuring we're legally protected at every turn. Nothing moves forward without legal approval.

Active Monitoring & Early Risk Detection

Risk isn't something you wait for - it's something you anticipate and act on. We employ machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies in borrower behavior. For example, missed payments, revenue declines, or other performance issues trigger early intervention to protect lender capital at the grass roots. Real-time insights ensure that no risk goes unnoticed.

Bottom Line:

Unsystematic risk is far more manageable than systematic risk. By applying rigorous underwriting, legal oversight, and early intervention, Avanza transforms unpredictable risk into calculated, strategic lending decisions.

The Avanza Capital Octopus Mentality: Mastering Risk from All Angles

At Avanza, we believe risk management is both an art and a science. Our strategy draws inspiration from the most sophisticated financial models and is symbolized by the octopus - a creature renowned for its adaptability, intelligence, and ability to operate with multiple ""arms"" working in unison. We've redefined the old adage: Bulls make money, bears make money, greedy pigs get slaughtered, and the octopus adapts - mastering every current, outmaneuvering every predator, and seizing every opportunity with precision, patience, and purpose. This isn't just a metaphor - it's our strategy in action.

8 Tentacles of Strategy

Just as the octopus controls eight arms simultaneously, we control eight key risk levers at once - spanning underwriting, collateral, legal, diversification, risk management, deal structure, partner transparency, and liquidity.

Decentralized Decision-Making

Each ""arm"" of our strategy operates independently. If one aspect of a deal falters (like a borrower missing a payment), the other risk controls (like collateral or promissory notes) step in to ensure lender protection.

Rapid Adaptation

Just as an octopus can change color or squeeze through small spaces, Avanza can adapt to sudden regulatory shifts, market changes, and borrower issues. We anticipate risks in real-time, ensuring our lending partners are never caught off guard.

Regeneration

The octopus can regenerate lost limbs. Avanza's diversified portfolio approach means that, even if one deal underperforms, it doesn't harm the larger portfolio. Our approach ensures that performance is never reliant on a single borrower, sector, or deal.

The Avanza Octopus Strategy in Practice:

When market conditions tighten, Avanza moves quickly, adjusting our underwriting process, reducing exposure to higher-risk borrowers, and repositioning capital into safer opportunities. Our octopus-inspired model has enabled us to thrive for 8 consecutive years.

How It All Comes Together

Systematic Risk: Impacts the entire economy and financial markets.

Unsystematic Risk: Deal-specific risks tied to borrowers, sectors, or deals.

How Avanza Combats Both:

Systematic Risk is mitigated through diversification, regulatory foresight, and fixed-rate returns.

Unsystematic Risk is controlled through underwriting, legal safeguards, and risk-adjusted returns.

By tackling both types of risk, Avanza delivers the kind of predictable, stable, and secure cash flow that accredited lending partners rely on. This dual approach enables us to provide 20% annualized returns, month after month, with the stability and transparency that sets Avanza apart in the alternative credit space.

Digging deeper:

Structuring the Deal: The Foundation of Avanza Capital Holdings Succes

Purchase Agreement: The Avanza Capital model is structured as an advanced purchase of future receivables, not a loan, creating a unique financing model.

Factor Rate: The cost of funding is based on a factor rate, ensuring clear repayment expectations.

Transparent Agreements: Contracts outline the percentage of receivables purchased and repayment terms in detail.

Adapting to Revenue Fluctuations: The Flexibility Advantage

Revenue-Driven Payments: Payments adjust dynamically to match the merchant's revenue fluctuations, reducing the burden during slow periods.

Daily or Weekly Deductions: Automatic ACH withdrawals simplify payment collection while ensuring consistency.

Simplified Qualification: Lowering Barriers to Entry

Cash Flow Focus: Avanza Capital approvals prioritize cash flow, revenue patterns, and receivables over traditional credit scores providing our borrowers with ""Action Capital"" to thrive and scale.

Key Metrics for Eligibility: Evaluating average daily sales and monthly revenue ensures accessible funding for small businesses.

Building Momentum in the Private Credit Revolution

Insights & Research

Direct Lending is Surging: Direct lending opportunities could exceed 8.5% annual returns over the next decade, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

The $30 Trillion Opportunity Ahead-yes, that's $30 with a ""T"":

https://avanza.nyc/the-next-era-of-private-credit/

Just to put it into perspective:

As of December 10, 2024, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization is approximately $3.66 trillion. Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency, accounting for about 55% of the total market cap, equating to roughly $2 trillion. Avanza Capital Holdings believes we are in one of the fastest growing sectors with institutional support and multiple expansion. The private credit market, encompassing non-bank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), has experienced significant growth, reaching approximately $2 trillion in assets under management by the end of 2023.

Private credit plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, particularly in supporting SMEs, which account for about 99.9% of all U.S. businesses and contribute to approximately half of the GDP. In 2022, private credit supported an estimated 1.6 million jobs, generating $137 billion in wages and benefits, and contributing $224 billion to the GDP.

https://www.investmentcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AIC-Private-Credit-Fact-Sheet_V8.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com

While private credit significantly impacts employment and economic activity, its direct contribution to the overall U.S. GDP is relatively modest. However, by providing essential financing to SMEs, private credit fosters business growth and innovation, indirectly bolstering economic development and competitiveness.

It's important to note that the private credit market's influence on the U.S. economy is multifaceted, affecting various metrics such as employment rates, business expansion, and overall economic resilience. As the market continues to evolve, its role in shaping economic outcomes is expected to grow correspondingly.

With private credit projected to grow to $2.8 trillion by 2028, Avanza is strategically positioned to capitalize on the expanding market.

Navigating Regulatory Transformation: As traditional banks face stricter regulations, alternative lending platforms like ours are poised to fill the gaps.

Avanza Capital Holdings: A Legacy of Legal Excellence and Unwavering Compliance Derived From A Leveraged Relationship Dating Back Over 3 Decades That Turned Into One Of The Most Profitable Relationships Ever

https://qpwblaw.com/qpwb-launches-securities-litigation-division-led-by-new-partner-anthony-c-varbero/

As 2024 comes to a close, we're proud to highlight one of the most critical pillars of Avanza Capital Holdings' success: our unwavering commitment to legal oversight and compliance. From day one, we've recognized that in the world of private credit, securing lender confidence requires more than returns - it requires trust, transparency, and absolute adherence to the law.

This year, our dedication to legal excellence has been publicly recognized, and we've taken intentional steps to ensure every aspect of our lending process remains fortified with the industry's highest standards of oversight. In this issue, we spotlight how our strategic reliance on top-tier legal counsel has become a defining advantage for Avanza, securing our place as a market leader in alternative banking and private credit.

Legal Oversight: The Bedrock of Our Lending Model

In an industry that continues to evolve with regulatory shifts like Basel III Endgame, the importance of a proactive legal strategy cannot be overstated. Unlike traditional alternative platforms and other alternative lenders, Avanza Capital Holdings' legal framework is not an afterthought - it is the cornerstone of our operations. From deal sourcing to contract structuring, our legal team ensures that every aspect of our lending model is built on rock-solid legal principles, positioning Avanza Capital as the ""Poster Boys"" of compliance - ahead of even the most sophisticated financial models.

Here's how our external legal counsel differentiates us from the pack:

* Rigorous Risk Mitigation: Every deal is subject to extensive legal review, ensuring airtight protection for our lending partners.

* Deal Structuring & Loan Security: Legal oversight ensures that all loans are backed by collateral, promissory notes, and binding agreements to protect lender capital.

* Regulatory Compliance: With the Basel III Endgame reshaping the financial industry, Avanza's legal team stays ahead of changes, safeguarding our business from unnecessary risks.

This focus on compliance isn't just theoretical. It's a well-documented part of our story.

Award-Winning Legal Strategy

This year, our legal approach was publicly recognized when Avanza Capital Holdings was named ""Best Outside Legal Team for Oversight of 2024"" by the Best of Best Review. This prestigious accolade reflects the standard of excellence we uphold in every transaction, giving lenders the confidence that their capital is secure.

https://www.americastop50lawyers.com/product-page/anthony-c-varbero-america-s-top-50-lawyer-securities-law-florida-new-york

The award recognizes our collaboration with one of America's Top 50 securities attorneys, who plays an active role in every major decision impacting lender protection, compliance, and legal soundness. Our legal counsel ensures every financial move we make is legally fortified, providing unmatched peace of mind to our accredited lenders.

How Legal Oversight Directly Impacts Lenders

Legal protection isn't just about contracts and regulations - it's about how we secure our lenders' returns. Here's how it works in practice:

Proactive Deal Sourcing & Screening:

Our legal team works hand-in-hand with our underwriters to vet every potential borrower. No deal is greenlit without legal clearance, ensuring compliance with both internal risk thresholds and external regulatory guidelines.

Transparent Terms & Conditions:

Every agreement is clearly structured to protect lender capital. Our collateralized loans come with full transparency on terms, timelines, and repayment schedules - with oversight from top-tier legal professionals.

Fortification Against Market Volatility:

In a year where market volatility was a recurring theme, our legal counsel was pivotal in protecting returns. The Basel III Endgame, which introduced new regulatory capital rules, created potential risks for lenders in traditional banking. Avanza's proactive legal strategy allowed us to remain flexible, secure, and compliant, giving our lending partners a distinct advantage.

Legal Innovation in Practice

At Avanza, ""innovation meets compliance"" isn't just a slogan. It's a lived philosophy. This commitment was highlighted in the following key articles and press mentions:

??Redefining Private Credit Markets with 10 Core Pillars of Excellence

Our 10 Core Pillars include Legal Transparency & Oversight as a critical driver of lender protection. It's a clear signal that compliance and transparency aren't reactive elements - they're baked into our operational DNA.

With the Basel III Endgame poised to reshape banking regulations, Avanza's legal strategy was showcased in this insightful feature. Thanks to our external legal counsel, we have proactively positioned our platform to mitigate risk and capitalize on opportunities.

??Anthony DeBenedictis Joins Forces with Frank Scarso to Propel Avanza Forward

The addition of Managing Partner Anthony DeBenedictis marked a new chapter in Avanza's story. As a leader in operational transparency, DeBenedictis worked directly with our legal team to drive the successful launch of our Lender Portal Pro. The result? Our lenders now have access to real-time updates and key legal disclosures on every deal.

A Commitment to Lender Protection and Oversight

Our guiding principle is clear: Protect lender capital at all costs. Legal oversight plays an indispensable role in fulfilling that promise. Every loan, agreement, and strategic move is backed by the most respected legal advisors in the financial industry, and that commitment is reflected in every success story we've shared with our lenders.

Our unwavering dedication to risk mitigation, legal integrity, and transparency ensures that accredited lenders know exactly where their capital is, how it's protected, and where it's growing.

supply chain risk,Impacts from the Threat of Tariffs in the Supply Chain,expertclick.com,https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/Impacts-from-the-Threat-of-Tariffs-in-the-Supply-Chain%2C2024308117.aspx,"The threat of tariffs is already causing supply chain implications. There is a surge of chip demand post election. According to Trendforce, the chip supply chain is seeing a rush of orders. The Commercial Times has said that Wi-fi chip sets are a major source of restocking in the first quarter of 2025. China's subsidy program for replacing old devices has depleted inventories. Additionally, the threat of tariffs is causing a pull-in effect exaggerated by the year-end peak season and Lunar New Year shutdown effects. Since China produces 60% of computer chips for the world, the threat of tariffs combined with the increasing use of advanced technologies is creating a demand surge. When demand and supply are out of alignment, disruptions occurs.

Trump said that he would impose 25% tariffs to Mexico and Canada if they didn't stop illegal drugs and migrants from crossing the borders into the U.S. According to FreightWaves and C.H. Robinson, this announcement created immediate customer concern. C.H. Robinson said that they have been pulled into countless customer meetings to run risk scenarios. Since many customers especially those with integrated supply chains like automotive consider treat North America as a singular supply chain, scenario planning has become a hot topic.

There are also concerns about the lack of labor resources. A mass deportation of undocumented migrants could greatly impact industries like construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Since labor shortages has already been a theme, these tariffs could add fuel to the fire. There are plenty of news articles raising these concerns in addition to the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. To learn more about how to proactively address labor shortages and other potential concerns, download our special report, FutureScape: Crafting Tomorrow's Supply Chain Today.

There are several companies reevaluating their supply chain. Although the elevated geopolitical and supply chain risk levels has been compelling a move to regional supply chains, the threat of tariffs pushes these initiatives into high gear. For example, medical devices and healthcare products put national security and a secure supply of critical products in focus. Thus, although these industries have been slower to reshore and expand U.S. manufacturing, a trend is starting to form.

According to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), ongoing and active shortages have reached a record high in the U.S. These types of risks are spurring a grow in regional manufacturing and expansion in the U.S. For example, Eli Lilly and Company announced a $3 billion expansion of the Kenosha County manufacturing facility that the company acquired earlier this year. It has also announced other multibillion-dollar manufacturing expansion projects near its Indianapolis headquarters. Reckitt Benckiser is also expanding U.S. manufacturing as it wants to respond faster to shifts in demand for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Thus, it is $200 million into a factory in North Carolina. And Nipro Medical Corporation, a leader in the global healthcare and medical device industry, announced that it has selected Pitt County for its first North American manufacturing center of excellence.

U.S. manufacturing has been contracting yet showing signs of growth with interest in expansions and reshoring of manufacturing. On the other hand, the Logistics Managers Index (LMI) has been in expansion territory and fueling positive trends as companies prepare for year-end, Lunar New Year, and the threat of tariffs. Most experts expect a good start to the New Year, followed by uncertainty as the new administration takes over. According to Brandon Fried, executive director of the US Airforwarders Association, we are bracing ourselves for a lacklustre year.

Amidst the concerns around tariffs, VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) is nothing new. Since the pandemic, the one constant has been change and disruption. These patterns will carry forward as supply chains evolve. Just using common sense, it is obvious that at a minimum, executives will be rethinking their supply chains. Companies that stay in business will assess their suppliers, evaluate manufacturing options, reassess investments, mitigate key risks, and will proactively navigating changing conditions in demand and supply with a process like SIOP (Sales Inventory Operations Planning).

By predicting demand and reallocating and redistributing their manufacturing capacity and logistics infrastructure, companies will stay ahead of VUCA, mitigate risks and maximize profits. It is vital to not become complacent in monitoring demand and supply and incorporate a review of key highlights, strategic decisions, and changing conditions it into a weekly, monthly, and quarterly SIOP cadence. To learn more about how to achieve SIOP success, download our complimentary book, SIOP: Creating Predictable Revenue and EBITDA Growth.

In addition to SIOP, proactive companies are transforming their supply chains. They are upgrading their planning processes, leveraging base technologies such as MRP systems, and taking the leap forward with advanced technologies such as advanced planning, predictive analytics, and leveraging robots and AI to automate, digitize, and proactively scale their capabilities.

supply chain risk,Will AI Reboot Supply Chains?,Global Finance Magazine,https://gfmag.com/technology/ai-reboot-global-supply-chains-shipping-costs-regulation/,"Advanced technologies are being deployed to tackle mounting global disruptions in the urgent battle for resilience.

Catastrophic weather events, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade conflicts, global pandemics -- the forces disrupting supply chains are multiplying at a rate few could have anticipated.

Since Covid-19 swept the globe, risks have spiraled, forcing governments, industry groups, nongovernmental organizations, and corporate CEOs and CFOs to rethink supply networks from the ground up. And the current threats show no sign of slowing.

As global supply chains brace for escalating tariffs, rising shipping costs, and an expanding regulatory landscape, companies are scrambling to adapt to demands for greener, more-resilient networks. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are bringing new tools to bear, but the fundamental challenges and growing fragility of globalization will remain, experts tell Global Finance.

""We're certainly in a new era of global supply chains, but it's not that today's risks were entirely unseen before,"" says Tinglong Dai, professor of Operations Management and Business Analytics at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School.

Extreme weather has always been a threat, but its frequency and intensity are now unparalleled, Dai says. Similarly, risks such as the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping have increased.

""The real shift,"" Dai explains, ""is in our recognition that the global supply chain model of the past 30 years is no longer sustainable, especially in light of new geopolitical realities. The US can no longer count on a China-centric supply chain structure to operate smoothly. We're moving toward what I would call a 'Supply Chain Iron Curtain.'""

Rising Shipping Costs

""The world has very much changed, and the risks of global manufacturing and transportation have increased tremendously,"" says Zach Zacharia, associate professor of supply chain management and director of the Center for Supply Chain Research at Lehigh University's College of Business. ""The large shipping lines are all not going through the Red Sea, and again that has changed the cost and time required to transport goods.""

Events have forced companies to look more closely at shipping costs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine dealt a blow to globalization, Zacharia continues. Before, it made sense to produce something at the lowest cost and then efficiently transport it.

""However, once Ukraine was attacked and Covid happened, you had to look at not just producing it cheaply but transporting it back safely at a low cost, which became much more critical,"" he says.

""We do see more volatility in maritime supply chains,"" says Jan Hoffmann, head of trade logistics at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It hasn't helped that ""key chokepoints like the Suez and Panama canals are increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, conflicts and climate change,"" as UNCTAD states in its Review of Maritime Transport 2024, published in September.

Tariffs could soon be a complicating factor, as US President-elect Donald Trump has stated his intention to expand their use. Tariffs were a big issue in the recent US presidential campaign but are viewed by many as a lose-lose strategy. They don't really make sense, because tariffs invariably provoke retaliatory tariffs, cautions Zacharia. Still, they seem likely to proliferate in the current geopolitical climate.

""A surge in trade conflicts, and especially between the USA and China, is altering traditional trade flows between these leading trade partners,"" says Rouben Indjikian, a professor at Webster University in Geneva and former executive director of Global Commodities Forum at UNCTAD. One recent example: China gets soya beans from Brazil at the expense of its traditional supplier, the US.

Elsewhere, globalization itself has brought a certain amount of ""just-in-time fragility,"" says Evan Smith, co-founder and CEO at Altana AI. Boeing, for example, used to control most of the value chain in the manufacture of its aircraft. ""Today it's doing only the final assembly of its planes,"" says Smith.

This means that if there is an interruption, for whatever reason, in deliveries of parts such as seats and engines from one or more upstream suppliers, the entire production line may have to shut down, as happened to Boeing in July.

""This outsourced, ... efficiency-at-all-costs supply chain [favored by so many companies] is efficient only under conditions of stability,"" which is not what we have today, Smith explains.

Companies and organizations need to embrace a diversified strategy that includes reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring, says Dai. ""It's not just about bringing production back to the US. That alone won't shield companies from risks, particularly those driven by climate change,"" he argues. ""We need to diversify not only across regions within the US but also by collaborating with allies and neighboring countries.""

Some have already traversed this path. ""Apple has been quite successful in de-risking its global supply chain. They've built in significant optionality and resilience, taking concrete steps to reduce reliance on any single country or region,"" says Dai.

A 'Sea Change In Regulation'

For corporations, managing their supply chains could get more complex -- and expensive -- given the current global regulatory climate. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence directive is already in force for some companies, yet only 9% of respondents in McKinsey's 2024 Global Supply Chain Leader Survey say that their supply chains are currently compliant with the new rules, which impose human rights and environmental due diligence requirements on large EU companies and on large non-EU companies operating in the EU.

UNCTAD recognizes that ""rapid decarbonization is critical"" regarding global supply chains, yet ""the transition to greener ships and low carbon fuels is still in its early stages.""

""There has been a big sea change in regulation,"" comments Smith. Governments now insist that companies be aware of what is happening across their supply chains to a degree not seen before.

The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was signed into law at the end of 2021, requires companies to take steps to prevent forced labor in their supply chains. The US Customs and Border Protection agency requires that all companies whose supply chains draw upon China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have to undertake and document extensive ""due diligence measures to ensure compliance with US laws and trace their supply chains for potential exposure to forced labor.""

This isn't always easy. A large US apparel firm might know who is manufacturing its garments, and the origins of the textiles used in that process, but may not have knowledge about the cotton that goes into those textiles. Today the apparel firm must ensure that forced labor isn't being used to pick the cotton that will be spun and woven into textiles and fashioned into clothes that will appear on US retail store shelves, says Smith.

Can New Technologies Make A Difference?

In this increasingly volatile supply risk environment, how does a company or organization mitigate these risks? Can emerging technologies, particularly AI, provide support?

More companies are now tapping into giant supply chain datasets and using machine learning algorithms to apply predictive analytics, ""allowing for very fast decision-making and mitigation of supply risks before they arise,"" says Peter Liddell, Global Operations Center of Excellence lead and Global Sustainable Supply Chain lead at KPMG Services in Singapore.

""Embracing AI is a high priority right now for global supply chain leaders across all industries and all jurisdictions,"" he continues. In KPMG's 2024 CEO Outlook, which surveyed 1,325 CEOs surveyed worldwide, supply chain disruption was rated a top threat to business growth.

By comparison, supply chain risk ranked only fifth in KPMG's 2022 survey. Importantly, Liddell notes, ""64% of global CEOs surveyed indicated that they would invest in AI regardless of the economic conditions.""

Many organizations are already using AI-based tools to improve supply chain ""visibility""; that is, the ability to track and monitor the movement of products and information throughout the supply network. Of supply chain leaders surveyed in the McKinsey report, 55% said they were using AI for this purpose, making it the technology's most common use case. And this rate of AI usage backs up the increasing complexity of supply chains, as the survey also reports that ""the share of respondents who say that they have good visibility into deeper levels of the supply chain fell by seven percentage points, the second consecutive annual decline in this measure.""

Where AI could prove really useful, though, according to Shawn Fitzgerald, senior research director at a strategic consulting firm, is in developing ""what if"" scenarios.

Using AI-enhanced predictive analytics to ""game out"" scenarios beforehand can vastly improve logistics, Fitzgerald suggests. A manager would ask the algorithm, for example, whether it is safer and more efficient to transport goods by air or by water.

Sustainability is a growing concern of governments, and supply chains can expect to come under more pressure to ensure that they are part of the solution, not the problem. Tracking every step in the supply chain process could eventually be a corporate imperative. If so, DLT may prove a useful tool, according to Liddell.

""The ability offered by DLTs for data visibility, to trace every transaction, and to identify the actors involved can enhance the reliability and accuracy of product traceability and tracking, especially in times of greater geopolitical uncertainty and as concerns over trading partners begin to grow,"" says Liddell.

""Visibility and traceability are two critical requirements for supply chains to enable ESG Scope 3 reporting,"" he adds. Those reporting requirements are a part of the international corporate value chain standard and could boost the adoption of DLTs and of blockchain at scale.

What Can CFOs Do?

Are there concrete steps that all corporate CEOs and CFOs should be taking to make their supply chains safer, considering growing geopolitical risks?

Some supply chain leaders are creating strategies for the next five to 10 years, adopting a greenfield-planning approach, says Liddell -- that is, building models from scratch, with a clean slate.

Several organizations are also working on plans to fully automate the supply chain planning function -- 100% automation -- ""but this is likely to be far more difficult than many expect,"" Liddell comments.

""My view is that organizations want to better understand their own risks, their suppliers' risks, and their suppliers' suppliers' risks, and ask for mitigation plans, but have not significantly increased their own investments in risk mitigation,"" says Shawn Muma, director of supply chain innovation and emerging technologies at the Digital Supply Chain Institute, a research organization of the Center for Global Enterprise.

This is the case even as new AI/machine learning tools become available to optimize business decision-making, like optimal machine learning (OML), a process that can handle enormous amounts of past and current supply-and-demand data and make recommendations on such matters as ideal production quantities and the most efficient shipping arrangements, Muma adds.

Digital enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is gaining in popularity among CEOs and CFOs, Webster University's Indjikian says. ERP permits companies to make supply chain an integral part of the overall planning of production, transportation, and distribution of their goods.

But ERP and digitalization can go only so far. ""While digitalization can make early warning systems better, they cannot easily overcome geopolitical risks and especially climate events and their consequences,"" notes Indjikian.

""It's really mostly about diversification,"" says UNCTAD's Hoffmann. ""A shipper will try to depend on several carriers, routes, ports, modes of transport, and goods suppliers.""

Companies should also strive to avoid letting supply chains become too deep, with too many levels, leaving them dependent not only on their supplier, but also on the supplier of their supplier and so on.

Overall, supply chain management must be valued by corporate boards and top-level management as no longer a mere back office, logistics type of job, a matter of making sure that goods show up on time in the most cost-efficient way, Altana AI's Smith argues.

Companies will have to raise supply chain management to an executive-level priority, suggests Fitzgerald. They will need to hire and retain the right talent, invest in ongoing training, and ""ensure there is a career track for supply chain professionals to advance and partner with the business over time.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"USA, Geneva, Brazil, Zacharia, McKinsey, US, Panama, Singapore, Ukraine, Russia, Smith, China"

supply chain risk,Businesses must ensure they take a considered approach when they implement AI: Beazley's Cox - Reinsurance News,ReinsuranceNe.ws,https://www.reinsurancene.ws/businesses-must-ensure-they-take-a-considered-approach-when-they-implement-ai-beazleys-cox/,"Despite the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence's (AI) potential, businesses should take stock and ensure that they are taking a considered approach as they implement the technology into their systems, says Adrian Cox, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Beazley, the specialist insurer.

""AI and how it can transform business has dominated conversation this year. This is likely to continue into 2025, with our latest Risk and Resilience report finding that 80% of companies are planning to integrate AI into business practices,"" Cox commented.

""But are businesses leaping in without looking and possibly opening themselves up to an accusation of 'AI-washing'?""

He continued: ""Amid the excitement surrounding AI's potential, businesses should take stock and ensure they are taking a considered approach as they implement AI, making sure that investment in AI does not divert attention away from getting the basics right, particularly around cyber risk.""

Earlier this year, a poll ran by Reinsurance News suggested that AI-powered threats will drive the biggest losses across the cyber re/insurance market over the next two years.

It's important to understand that this should not come as too much of a surprise, given the widespread adoption of AI technology across the re/insurance sector in recent years.

Going back to Cox, he states that businesses will benefit from exercising caution and not overstating the use or impact of AI on their services and profitability.

Adding: ""In the US for example, we have already seen a number of high-profile cases cracking down on AI-washing, including the Securities and Exchange Commission's fines on investment advisors Delphia and Global Predictions. We are likely to see similar actions in other regions.""

He concludes: ""AI certainly has an important role to play in the future of business, but as with the Railroad or Dotcom Booms and Busts before it, the route to AI success may not be smooth.""

A paper released earlier this year by Guy Carpenter highlighted how the rapid adoption and evolving deployment of AI in recent years has heightened the risk of cyber event aggregation from both malicious and accidental sources.

The paper identified four key ways in which AI development and deployment contribute to this aggregation: software supply chain risk, expansion of the attack surface, increased data exposure, and growing usage in cyber security operations.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Dotcom Booms, US"

supply chain risk,NEW REPORT HIGHLIGHTS PATHWAYS TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY,Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/12/n42383915/new-report-highlights-pathways-to-a-sustainable-future-for-the-food-and-beverage-industry,"OSLO, Norway, Dec. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DNV, the independent assurance and risk management provider, published a new report highlighting the urgent need for the food and beverage sector to transform its supply chains to meet sustainability demands amid global challenges like climate change, regulatory shifts, and evolving consumer expectations.

The report 'The Future of Sustainable Food Supply Chains: Spotlight on Europe's Food and Beverage Industry' reveals that sustainability has become the number one supply chain priority for food and beverage companies, with 75% ranking it among their top three goals, ahead of cost efficiency (63%) and regulatory compliance (49%).

To succeed, companies must adopt a holistic approach that integrates visibility, digital transformation, and compliance with emerging regulations.

With food systems accounting for a third of global carbon emissions, the report identifies critical areas where the industry must focus to balance environmental responsibility, cost-efficiency, and compliance with increasingly stringent regulations.

The report's key findings on critical challenges facing food and beverage supply chains include:

Digital transformation as a catalyst: The adoption of digital tools such as supply chain traceability, connected product passport as well as supply chain risk management platforms is gaining momentum, but the sector lags behind others in integrating key technologies. A focus on verifiable and trusted data, as well as ease of use across all supply chain actors is essential to enable transparency and cost-effective compliance.Evolving regulatory landscape: New EU directives, including the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Packaging Waste Directive, are driving companies to address sustainability comprehensively, from carbon footprints to human rights concerns.Consumer and retailer influence: Today's informed consumers demand sustainable and transparent food production practices and are willing to pay a premium for products aligned with their values. Retailers, especially those with private labels, are pushing for deeper collaboration with suppliers to meet these expectations.

""The food and beverage industry faces an era of significant transformation as sustainability within the entire supply chain becomes an urgent priority. Global disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the growing impact of climate change, have intensified existing challenges while introducing new complexities to the industry's supply chains,"" said Geir Fuglerud, CEO - Supply Chain & Product Assurance at DNV. ""This report is a blueprint for companies to address the challenges ahead, leveraging digital innovation to balance cost-efficiency and environmental responsibility.""

While digital transformation is crucial for creating lean and green supply chains, the report's findings highlight that it must be coupled with robust methodologies for data collection and verification. Technologies like AI offer immense potential to enhance visibility and traceability, but fragmented standards and siloed data systems remain key barriers.

As climate change accelerates and global populations grow, the food and beverage sector must embrace a holistic, technology-driven approach to sustainability. Collaboration across the supply chain, bolstered by strategic partnerships and adherence to rigorous standards, will be essential in shaping a more sustainable and efficient future.

supply chain risk,MINING LEASE APPLICATION SUBMITTED FOR NORRA KÄRR,ForexTV,https://forextv.com/mining-lease-application-submitted-for-norra-karr/,"MINING LEASE APPLICATION SUBMITTED FOR NORRA KÄRR

Vancouver, December 8, 2024 - Leading Edge Materials Corp. (""Leading Edge Materials"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: LEM) (Nasdaq First North: LEMSE) (OTCQB: LEMIF) announces that an application for an Exploitation Concession (""Bearbetningskoncession"") 25-year mining lease has been submitted to the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (""Bergsstaten"") for the Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earths (HREE) Project.

Norra Kärr had previously been granted a Bearbetningskoncession, in 2013, when the Company proposed that mining and all processing activities be located at the Norra Kärr site.

The Norra Kärr project was fundamentally redesigned in the 2021, following feedback from stakeholders, completely decoupling mining and chemical processing activities, with the latter relocated away from the mine site. The redesign was the basis for the Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2021 (""PEA 2021""). A reminder of the financial highlights from the PEA2021 are included later in this news release.

The Bearbetningskoncession application is accordingly for the quarrying operation that is proposed at the Norra Kärr site, producing a HREE concentrate and the industrial mineral nepheline syenite. Downstream chemical processing of the HREE concentrate will take place at an industrial park alongside similar industries, with Luleå being a preferred location.

When compared to the Pre-feasibility Study in 2015 (""PFS 2015""), the PEA 2021 reduced the area for operations at Norra Kärr by 65%, reduced water usage by up to 30%, and increased the conversion of excavated materials to products from ~ 1% to at least 60%. The Company plans to conduct testwork in Q1 2025 to further investigate the market potential of both nepheline syenite and aegirine. Aegirine is classified as waste in the current design but could be a saleable product.

Kurt Budge, Chief Executive Officer, states:

""Climate change, war and geopolitics are making critical raw materials headline news, with the Green Transition in Europe now sharing coverage with security and defense. The need for robust critical raw material supply chains is an imperative for the region.

In 2014, a report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must [therefore] remain an urgent priority...'.

The Report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades'.

The Norra Kärr journey started long before this, with its discovery by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) in the early 1900s. In more recent times, SGU designated Norra Kärr a mineral deposit of national interest in July 2011, linked to its potential for providing a supply of rare earth elements to Sweden and Europe. At the time, the SGU stated ""REEs are of great importance in modern society and access to these elements is very limited within Europe. Norra Kärr is a very important project from a material supply point of view, both for Sweden as well as for Europe. The mineral resource at Norra Kärr is the only NI 43-101 compliant REE resource in mainland Europe"".

The new Bearbetningskoncession application is for a project with significantly reduced environmental impact and significantly increased sustainability. Proposed activities at the Norra Kärr site will be similar in nature to any other quarrying operation and downstream chemical processes will be removed from the mining site.

In August, the Company submitted an application to the European Commission (EC) for Strategic Project designation for Norra Kärr. Norra Kärr can make a significant contribution to Sweden and the EU's preparedness, greater self-reliance and resilience when it comes to HREE requirements and the strategically important industries that depend on them.

Looking ahead, 2025 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Norra Kärr, with decisions to be taken on Strategic Project status and thereafter the Bearbetningskoncession. The Company is also planning for the start of Pre-feasibility.""

Recap - Preliminary Economic Assessment 2021 (PEA)

The PEA was prepared by SRK (UK) Ltd. (""SRK"") and all figures in the PEA are in US dollars unless otherwise specified. SRK re-evaluated the Project with the objective to improve resource utilization, project sustainability and substantially minimize its environmental footprint compared to the design in the PFS 2015.

Norra Kärr's Relevance to the EU:

Norra Kärr is an upstream asset that could be the EU's first step in HREE primary production and the establishment of a secure, resilient, and sustainable value chain for REEs; helping to strengthen the EU's self-reliance and to reduce strategic dependency on China.

There is a railway within 30 kilometers of the Norra Kärr site. The location provides uninterrupted road and rail access to Baltic ports and onto European markets where both REE refining capacity and REE enabled technology consumers are located.

EU demand for rare earth metals is expected to increase six-fold by 2030. The EU is almost 100% dependent on China for HREEs.

A report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) in 2014 titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must therefore remain an urgent priority for Europe.'

The report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades.' Norra Kärr is one of two 'best known' advanced stage REE projects in Europe, which given size and grade could potentially contribute to Europe's security of supply of REE for decades to come.

In May 2023, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), in the report titled Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion - A European Call for Action, identified over 50 investment cases targeting materials for energy storage and conversion across Europe and beyond, and a total investment need exceeding EUR 15 billion. Norra Kärr was one of the projects identified, that combined with the others, if realized, would make a significant contribution to the EU's needs by 2030. The report acknowledged that there is limited primary production within the EU and for some materials related to energy storage, the EU relies almost entirely on imports.

Critical Raw Materials Act:

On 18 March 2024, the European Council adopted the regulation to establish a framework to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials, known as the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA).

The CRMA introduces clear deadlines for permit procedures for EU extracting projects, allows the Commission and member states to recognize a project as strategic, requires supply-chain risk assessments, requires member states to have national exploration plans and ensures the EU's access to critical and strategic raw materials through ambitious benchmarks on extraction, processing, recycling and diversification of import sources.

On 23 May 2024, a call for Strategic Projects as defined by the CRMA was opened. The CRMA designates strategic projects to increase EU capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. Strategic raw materials are crucial for the success of the green and digital transitions as well as the resilience of the defense and aerospace sectors.

Vancouver, December 8, 2024 - Leading Edge Materials Corp. (""Leading Edge Materials"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: LEM) (Nasdaq First North: LEMSE) (OTCQB: LEMIF) announces that an application for an Exploitation Concession (""Bearbetningskoncession"") 25-year mining lease has been submitted to the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (""Bergsstaten"") for the Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earths (HREE) Project.

Norra Kärr had previously been granted a Bearbetningskoncession, in 2013, when the Company proposed that mining and all processing activities be located at the Norra Kärr site.

The Norra Kärr project was fundamentally redesigned in the 2021, following feedback from stakeholders, completely decoupling mining and chemical processing activities, with the latter relocated away from the mine site. The redesign was the basis for the Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2021 (""PEA 2021""). A reminder of the financial highlights from the PEA2021 are included later in this news release.

The Bearbetningskoncession application is accordingly for the quarrying operation that is proposed at the Norra Kärr site, producing a HREE concentrate and the industrial mineral nepheline syenite. Downstream chemical processing of the HREE concentrate will take place at an industrial park alongside similar industries, with Luleå being a preferred location.

When compared to the Pre-feasibility Study in 2015 (""PFS 2015""), the PEA 2021 reduced the area for operations at Norra Kärr by 65%, reduced water usage by up to 30%, and increased the conversion of excavated materials to products from ~ 1% to at least 60%. The Company plans to conduct testwork in Q1 2025 to further investigate the market potential of both nepheline syenite and aegirine. Aegirine is classified as waste in the current design but could be a saleable product.

Kurt Budge, Chief Executive Officer, states:

""Climate change, war and geopolitics are making critical raw materials headline news, with the Green Transition in Europe now sharing coverage with security and defense. The need for robust critical raw material supply chains is an imperative for the region.

In 2014, a report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must [therefore] remain an urgent priority...'.

The Report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades'.

The Norra Kärr journey started long before this, with its discovery by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) in the early 1900s. In more recent times, SGU designated Norra Kärr a mineral deposit of national interest in July 2011, linked to its potential for providing a supply of rare earth elements to Sweden and Europe. At the time, the SGU stated ""REEs are of great importance in modern society and access to these elements is very limited within Europe. Norra Kärr is a very important project from a material supply point of view, both for Sweden as well as for Europe. The mineral resource at Norra Kärr is the only NI 43-101 compliant REE resource in mainland Europe"".

The new Bearbetningskoncession application is for a project with significantly reduced environmental impact and significantly increased sustainability. Proposed activities at the Norra Kärr site will be similar in nature to any other quarrying operation and downstream chemical processes will be removed from the mining site.

In August, the Company submitted an application to the European Commission (EC) for Strategic Project designation for Norra Kärr. Norra Kärr can make a significant contribution to Sweden and the EU's preparedness, greater self-reliance and resilience when it comes to HREE requirements and the strategically important industries that depend on them.

Looking ahead, 2025 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Norra Kärr, with decisions to be taken on Strategic Project status and thereafter the Bearbetningskoncession. The Company is also planning for the start of Pre-feasibility.""

Recap - Preliminary Economic Assessment 2021 (PEA)

The PEA was prepared by SRK (UK) Ltd. (""SRK"") and all figures in the PEA are in US dollars unless otherwise specified. SRK re-evaluated the Project with the objective to improve resource utilization, project sustainability and substantially minimize its environmental footprint compared to the design in the PFS 2015.

Norra Kärr's Relevance to the EU:

Norra Kärr is an upstream asset that could be the EU's first step in HREE primary production and the establishment of a secure, resilient, and sustainable value chain for REEs; helping to strengthen the EU's self-reliance and to reduce strategic dependency on China.

There is a railway within 30 kilometers of the Norra Kärr site. The location provides uninterrupted road and rail access to Baltic ports and onto European markets where both REE refining capacity and REE enabled technology consumers are located.

EU demand for rare earth metals is expected to increase six-fold by 2030. The EU is almost 100% dependent on China for HREEs.

A report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) in 2014 titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must therefore remain an urgent priority for Europe.'

The report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades.' Norra Kärr is one of two 'best known' advanced stage REE projects in Europe, which given size and grade could potentially contribute to Europe's security of supply of REE for decades to come.

In May 2023, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), in the report titled Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion - A European Call for Action, identified over 50 investment cases targeting materials for energy storage and conversion across Europe and beyond, and a total investment need exceeding EUR 15 billion. Norra Kärr was one of the projects identified, that combined with the others, if realized, would make a significant contribution to the EU's needs by 2030. The report acknowledged that there is limited primary production within the EU and for some materials related to energy storage, the EU relies almost entirely on imports.

Critical Raw Materials Act:

On 18 March 2024, the European Council adopted the regulation to establish a framework to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials, known as the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA).

The CRMA introduces clear deadlines for permit procedures for EU extracting projects, allows the Commission and member states to recognize a project as strategic, requires supply-chain risk assessments, requires member states to have national exploration plans and ensures the EU's access to critical and strategic raw materials through ambitious benchmarks on extraction, processing, recycling and diversification of import sources.

On 23 May 2024, a call for Strategic Projects as defined by the CRMA was opened. The CRMA designates strategic projects to increase EU capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. Strategic raw materials are crucial for the success of the green and digital transitions as well as the resilience of the defense and aerospace sectors.

Vancouver, December 8, 2024 - Leading Edge Materials Corp. (""Leading Edge Materials"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: LEM) (Nasdaq First North: LEMSE) (OTCQB: LEMIF) announces that an application for an Exploitation Concession (""Bearbetningskoncession"") 25-year mining lease has been submitted to the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (""Bergsstaten"") for the Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earths (HREE) Project.

Norra Kärr had previously been granted a Bearbetningskoncession, in 2013, when the Company proposed that mining and all processing activities be located at the Norra Kärr site.

The Norra Kärr project was fundamentally redesigned in the 2021, following feedback from stakeholders, completely decoupling mining and chemical processing activities, with the latter relocated away from the mine site. The redesign was the basis for the Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2021 (""PEA 2021""). A reminder of the financial highlights from the PEA2021 are included later in this news release.

The Bearbetningskoncession application is accordingly for the quarrying operation that is proposed at the Norra Kärr site, producing a HREE concentrate and the industrial mineral nepheline syenite. Downstream chemical processing of the HREE concentrate will take place at an industrial park alongside similar industries, with Luleå being a preferred location.

When compared to the Pre-feasibility Study in 2015 (""PFS 2015""), the PEA 2021 reduced the area for operations at Norra Kärr by 65%, reduced water usage by up to 30%, and increased the conversion of excavated materials to products from ~ 1% to at least 60%. The Company plans to conduct testwork in Q1 2025 to further investigate the market potential of both nepheline syenite and aegirine. Aegirine is classified as waste in the current design but could be a saleable product.

Kurt Budge, Chief Executive Officer, states:

""Climate change, war and geopolitics are making critical raw materials headline news, with the Green Transition in Europe now sharing coverage with security and defense. The need for robust critical raw material supply chains is an imperative for the region.

In 2014, a report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must [therefore] remain an urgent priority...'.

The Report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades'.

The Norra Kärr journey started long before this, with its discovery by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) in the early 1900s. In more recent times, SGU designated Norra Kärr a mineral deposit of national interest in July 2011, linked to its potential for providing a supply of rare earth elements to Sweden and Europe. At the time, the SGU stated ""REEs are of great importance in modern society and access to these elements is very limited within Europe. Norra Kärr is a very important project from a material supply point of view, both for Sweden as well as for Europe. The mineral resource at Norra Kärr is the only NI 43-101 compliant REE resource in mainland Europe"".

The new Bearbetningskoncession application is for a project with significantly reduced environmental impact and significantly increased sustainability. Proposed activities at the Norra Kärr site will be similar in nature to any other quarrying operation and downstream chemical processes will be removed from the mining site.

In August, the Company submitted an application to the European Commission (EC) for Strategic Project designation for Norra Kärr. Norra Kärr can make a significant contribution to Sweden and the EU's preparedness, greater self-reliance and resilience when it comes to HREE requirements and the strategically important industries that depend on them.

Looking ahead, 2025 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Norra Kärr, with decisions to be taken on Strategic Project status and thereafter the Bearbetningskoncession. The Company is also planning for the start of Pre-feasibility.""

Norra Kärr's Relevance to the EU:

Norra Kärr is an upstream asset that could be the EU's first step in HREE primary production and the establishment of a secure, resilient, and sustainable value chain for REEs; helping to strengthen the EU's self-reliance and to reduce strategic dependency on China.

There is a railway within 30 kilometers of the Norra Kärr site. The location provides uninterrupted road and rail access to Baltic ports and onto European markets where both REE refining capacity and REE enabled technology consumers are located.

EU demand for rare earth metals is expected to increase six-fold by 2030. The EU is almost 100% dependent on China for HREEs1.

A report by The European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON) in 2014 titled Strengthening The European Rare Earths Supply-Chain stated that 'The development of new sources of heavy rare earths outside of China and greater recycling must therefore remain an urgent priority for Europe.'2

The report, now a decade old, stated that 'With adequate funding and permitting, mining could begin [at Norra Kärr] before 2020 and secure European REE supply for decades.' Norra Kärr is one of two 'best known' advanced stage REE projects in Europe, which given size and grade could potentially contribute to Europe's security of supply of REE for decades to come.

In May 2023, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), in the report titled Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion - A European Call for Action3, identified over 50 investment cases targeting materials for energy storage and conversion across Europe and beyond, and a total investment need exceeding EUR 15 billion. Norra Kärr was one of the projects identified, that combined with the others, if realized, would make a significant contribution to the EU's needs by 2030. The report acknowledged that there is limited primary production within the EU and for some materials related to energy storage, the EU relies almost entirely on imports.

Critical Raw Materials Act:

On 18 March 2024, the European Council adopted the regulation to establish a framework to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials, known as the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA).

The CRMA introduces clear deadlines for permit procedures for EU extracting projects, allows the Commission and member states to recognize a project as strategic, requires supply-chain risk assessments, requires member states to have national exploration plans and ensures the EU's access to critical and strategic raw materials through ambitious benchmarks on extraction, processing, recycling and diversification of import sources.

On 23 May 2024, a call for Strategic Projects as defined by the CRMA was opened. The CRMA designates strategic projects to increase EU capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. Strategic raw materials are crucial for the success of the green and digital transitions as well as the resilience of the defense and aerospace sectors.

The fact only China, Mexico and Canada are within scope of Trump's first round of tariffs means shippers who frontloaded imports from any other nation following his election victory may have wasted time and money, Xeneta noted.

They may have needlessly moved containers on the elevated spot market if they exceed minimum quantity commitments (MQC), while bloated inventories increase warehouse costs and take up working capital, the Norway-based ocean and air freight rate benchmarking and market analytics platform said in a release.

As Trump will make further announcements on tariffs, and they could impact any category of goods or region in the world, so shippers must be ready to act decisively if they want to frontload imports while avoiding unnecessary freight spend, it said.

If a shipper is against the clock to import goods before tariffs come into effect, understanding actual transit times to choose the right carrier for their trade lanes is vital, or else they risk incurring the substantial cost of frontloading but see their goods arrive in the United States too late to benefit from it, it said.

Average spot rates on major front-haul trades are an important barometer for the market -- and numerous ocean freight rate indexes offer this -- but, in isolation, they do not provide the depth and breadth of data required to effectively manage freight spend and supply chain risk in this scenario.

A shipper may look at average spot rates on their trade and be willing to pay a higher rate to ship goods if a carrier's announced transit time ensures the container arrives in the United States before tariffs come into effect, Xeneta suggested.

Given the heightened geopolitical tension globally, there is also the risk of further, as-yet-unknown, disruptions emerging that threaten supply chains.

""Average spot rates will only take you so far in understanding how to manage these threats. You must have visibility at a port-to-port level on the different rates carriers are offering across long and short term markets as well transit times, schedule reliability and capacity,"" Xeneta added.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Mexico, Norway, Canada, China, the United States"
supply chain risk,Market insiders see cyber premium booming,Business Insurance,https://www.businessinsurance.com/market-insiders-see-cyber-premium-booming/,"The commercial cyber liability insurance market will likely grow dramatically over the next several years, according to industry sources.

Some see a doubling or tripling of gross written premium in the next decade, driven by larger organizations seeking higher limits and greater penetration among small and medium-sized enterprises.

The growth is being fueled by established insurers increasing line sizes and new entrants adding capacity to the sector, sources said. The sector also tapped the capital markets for the first time in late 2023, through the issuance of insurance-linked securities, or cyber cat bonds (see related story below).

Gallagher Re, the reinsurance business of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., estimates the global cyber insurance market will end 2024 at about $14.8 billion, having grown from $13.1 billion in 2023, said Jasper Goring, New York-based head of cyber reinsurance, North America, for the reinsurance broker.

""No one has the exact same data, but virtually everybody's data does show the market getting bigger,"" Mr. Goring said.

""The market will carry on growing to a $20 billion, $25 billion, $30 billion-plus global cyber market,"" with the timing of that growth more difficult to forecast due to ""external forces that are impossible to predict,"" such as macroeconomic factors, he said.

San Francisco-based CyberCube Analytics Inc. recently projected that the U.S. stand-alone cyber insurance industry would grow to at least $45 billion in premium over the next 10 years, ""but it has a capacity to grow substantially larger than that,"" said CyberCube CEO Pascal Millaire.

In the near term, the global cyber market is forecast to reach almost $20 billion in 2025 and $29 billion in 2027, according to Munich, Germany-based Cyrus Delarami, underwriting manager, corporate underwriting cyber, at Munich Reinsurance Co.

Munich Re pegged the 2023 market at approximately $14 billion, meaning the market could roughly double over the next three years, according to the reinsurer's estimate. Premium is heavily weighted toward the U.S., which accounts for about 70% of global cyber premium, followed by Europe, Mr. Delarami said.

Penetration rates across Asia and the rest of the world are substantially lower, most sources said, posing a potential opportunity for growth.

While the commercial cyber insurance sector is still dwarfed by the rest of the commercial property/casualty business, ""We know that we have to do something about it because it's one of the biggest risks that we are facing as a society,"" Mr. Delarami said.

Growth could come from increased penetration among small and medium-sized enterprises, said Michael Phillips, New York-based U.S. cyber practice leader, at specialist insurer CFC Group Ltd.

CFC estimates penetration rates could be as low as 10% among SMEs, he said. Increased focus on products designed specifically for the segment should lead to more traction.

At the other end of the market, large cyber insurance buyers continue to add limits, Mr. Phillips said. Some of the largest buyers of cyber insurance have built $1 billion towers, a threshold that was ""mythical for a long time,"" he said.

""We have seen many increase the limits that they currently buy for a variety of reasons,"" including third-party supply chain risk, Rachel Lavender, Washington-based U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader for Marsh LLC, said of the large account segment.

Cyber insurance market capacity is expanding to accommodate the demand, she said.

""We are seeing a continued growth in the supply of capacity with new markets as well as existing markets increasing the level of capacity that they're offering on any one account,"" Ms. Lavender said.

Axa XL, a unit of Axa S.A., established a middle-market cyber unit, said Michelle Chia, New York-based chief underwriting officer, cyber, Americas.

""We must be in the middle market and small, mid-sized space"" to create a resilient environment, which will benefit all policyholders due to the highly integrated and connected nature of business operations, Ms. Chia said.

The fourth quarter of 2023 witnessed the birth of the public ""cyber cat bond,"" as the commercial cyber insurance sector, for the first time, turned to the capital markets for capacity.

The capital provided by these tradeable financial instruments will foster growth of commercial cyber insurance markets, sources said.

""In order for the cyber insurance market to grow and reach its potential, it needs capacity, alternative capacity from the ILS market,"" said Pascal Millaire, CEO of San Francisco-based CyberCube Analytics Inc., which models quantitative loss of cyber incidents for insurance industry clients such as insurers, reinsurers -- including ILS sponsors -- and brokers.

In the fourth quarter of last year, cyber ILS accounted for 7.5% of all issuance, ""which is quite remarkable from a standing start,"" Mr. Millaire said. ""We think we're just at the very early innings in terms of how large a cyber ILS market could become and, frankly, needs to become, to support the growth of the cyber insurance industry.""

""We think ILS will be a really important tool and source of capital for the cyber market in the future,"" said Jasper Goring, New York-based head of cyber reinsurance, North America, for Gallagher Re, the reinsurance business of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

""We've done a huge amount in the last 18 to 24 months with developing new reinsurance vehicles in order to unlock additional alternative capital. That's been very much with a view to the future. If the market is going to carry on growing to $20 billion, $30 billion, then we are going to need the alternative capital or a richer menu of reinsurance vehicles that can attract a broader, deeper pool of capital,"" Mr. Goring said.

""There's extraordinary promise in engaging with the capital markets alongside the traditional reinsurance market to make sure that the cyber insurance market as a whole is sustainable for the long term,"" said Michael Phillips, New York-based U.S. cyber practice leader at specialist insurer CFC Group Ltd.",,"billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion",,N/A,N/A,"U.S., Munich, Washington, Canada, Germany, San Francisco, New York"
supply chain risk,How Companies Can Guard Against A Tariff-Related Supply Chain Crisis,expertclick.com,"https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/How-Companies-Can-Guard-Against-A-TariffRelated-Supply-Chain-Crisis,2024308090.aspx","Commentary by Edward Segal, a crisis management expert and author of Crisis Ahead: 101 Ways to Prepare for and Bounce Back from Disasters, Scandals, and Other Emergencies.

The nation's fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

""These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,"" Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That's because ""once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,"" according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

Proactive Measures

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

Seek Supply Chain Alternatives

""Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump''s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

""Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,"" she pointed out.

Stockpile Inventory

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,"" Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

Diversify

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,"" he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,"" Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

Manage Financial Impact

""Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,"" Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

Plan Ahead

""Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,"" he commented.

Challenges

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

""A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn't changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,"" the report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

""The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,"" according to the survey results.

Fewer Discussions

""Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,"" the report pointed out.

""If you're not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you're flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,"" Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,"" advised in an email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

""At the end of the day, this isn't just about tariffs. It's about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It's about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously -- invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships -- will not just weather the storm; they'll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,"" he commented.

Evolve

""Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,"" Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

The nation's fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

""These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,"" Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That's because ""once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,"" according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

""Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump''s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

""Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,"" she pointed out.

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,"" Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

supply chain risk,INTROSupply to support compliance with EU CSDDD,list.lu,https://www.list.lu/en/news/introsupply-to-support-compliance-with-eu-csddd/?no_cache=1&cHash=8c693741c1525d602c365360a4256127,"The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) is just here, and it's about to redefine companies value chains across Europe and beyond. This isn't just another regulation -- it's a call to action for companies to rethink their approach to risk, responsibility, and resilience.

This Directive, adopted in July 2024 by the EU, aims to promote sustainable and responsible business practices, compelling companies to address their impact on human rights and the environment both within Europe and throughout their global value chains. CSDDD, which will be transposed into Luxembourg law, and will come into operation in a staggered way in the coming years, is about future-proofing your business.

By 2029, the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will apply to approximately 6,000 companies. These are businesses with over 1,000 employees and global revenues exceeding EUR 450 million. This marks the final stage of a phased rollout, which initially targets larger corporations in 2027 and 2028.

Non-EU companies with a significant presence in Europe are also in the spotlight. Roughly 900 international firms generating more than EUR 450 million in EU revenue are required to comply with the new rules.

While SMEs and micro-companies aren't directly covered, they won't be unaffected. As crucial suppliers in global value chains, many smaller businesses will face growing pressure from larger partners to align with the new standards as from 2027.

The Directive isn't just a box-ticking exercise. Indeed, CSDDD mandates companies to identify and address human rights and environmental risks throughout their operations, subsidiaries, and supply chains; and implement a climate transition plan to contribute to the EU's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

For companies willing to take proactive steps, this regulation represents an opportunity. By embedding sustainability into their core operations, businesses can enhance their resilience, build stronger value chains, and boost their reputation as ethical market leaders.

The Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) and CURE Intelligence have initiated the INTROSupply research project, co-funded by the Ministry of the Economy, where they developed the Scrioo platform, a supply chain risk management solution designed to simplify compliance with CSDDD and minimize disruption.

""The complexity of modern supply chains demands proactive solutions,"" says Djamel Khadraoui, Head of Reliable Distributed Systems Unit at LIST. ""Scrioo's AI-driven risk detection and predictive capabilities from CURE Intelligence allow businesses to anticipate disruptions and address potential threats before they escalate, transforming compliance from a reactive process into a strategic advantage.""

The platform offers a data-driven risk detection using advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms that can automatically scan, categorize, flag potential supply chain threats and predict disruptions which will enable companies to act before issues arise. Automated tools for generating compliance reports and conducting regulatory audits, ensuring businesses are always ready for scrutiny.",,,,N/A,N/A,Luxembourg
supply chain risk,"AI uses so much water. If Midwest wants tech growth, let's plan to sustain it. | Opinion",The Sheboygan Press,https://eu.sheboyganpress.com/story/opinion/2024/12/06/microsoft-quantum-ev-chips-lake-michigan-water-wisconsin/76455710007/,"Take a flight around the Microsoft Corp. data center campus construction site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin as construction continues.

The Midwest is on the brink of a new economic era. Once a manufacturing stronghold, the Great Lakes region is poised to lead again, fueled by fresh industrial investments like Microsoft's $3.3 billion AI hub in Wisconsin and the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, backed by $1.6 billion in initial investment. The IQMP will be home to company operations for PsiQuantum as well as a quantum proving ground and quantum education programs.

Our economic strength isn't just about people, logistics or markets -- it's also about water. With 20% of the world's fresh water, the Great Lakes region's future hinges on smart, sustainable water strategies to support booming industries like EV batteries, quantum computing and semiconductor chip manufacturing, and data centers.

While the United States leads the world in chip innovation, we lag in manufacturing: more than 90% of chips are made overseas. Serious chips shortages in 2021 underscored how dependent global industry is on key suppliers like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Reducing that supply chain risk is a major reason for the push to accelerate domestic chip manufacturing amid rising demand, driven in large part by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In fact, a semiconductor facility in Michigan within the Great Lakes watershed is under construction in Michigan.

But semiconductor manufacturing has a water problem it has to solve first. The average chip manufacturing facility can use 10 million gallons of ultrapure water per day, the equivalent usage of 33,000 US households. And it's not just water in, but also water out: chip manufacturing also produces wastewater, polluted with heavy metals and other contaminants. Data centers use massive amounts of water and energy for cooling; a 2021 report from Virginia Tech researchers unpacked these needs in great detail.

Great Lakes region can leverage its freshwater advantage

Regions facing water shortages struggle to combat water supply issues. By contrast, the Great Lakes region can harness our freshwater advantage to attract investment and high-quality jobs that drive economic growth.

But we can only do it if we are intentional, strategic, and focused on the long-term sustainability and quality of our water. Otherwise, we risk draining the advantage that sustains our industry and communities.

There are at least two essential parts to smart water strategy. The first is a shift in water reuse strategy. Industrial users rely on water for fabrication, cooling and washing; wastewater could be used for tasks that currently use but don't require clean drinking water.

The second part is changing our reclamation strategy. Conventional wastewater flushes valuable resources down the drain and leaves harmful contaminants behind. Smart, sustainable water strategy takes a different approach, focusing on selective separation of contaminants like heavy metals and forever chemicals and resource recovery of valuable minerals like lithium, nickel and cobalt. This means we can reuse more wastewater, lessen the impact on the environment and reduce our dependence on critical minerals from overseas.

Resource recovery technologies and processes aren't pie in the sky: they're real, available to deploy today, and we're making continual strides to innovate for tomorrow. But we need more industry leaders to adopt them and policymakers to support them, especially here in the Great Lakes, where our leadership on reuse and reclamation can lag behind places facing conditions of water scarcity.

Grant will help us learn how to manage precious water resources

It's the premise behind Current and Great Lakes ReNEW, which in January was awarded up to $160 million over 10 years by the National Science Foundation precisely to lead such innovation in resource recovery. Our engine was selected in large part because the NSF understands that supporting growth in water-intensive industries like semiconductor chip manufacturing and quantum computing is of strategic national importance.

And with a six-state coalition with more than 50 partners, we're working with utilities, industry and research institutions to accelerate progress, including a growing coalition with shared interest in policies that encourage and incentivize smarter strategies for water use and reuse.

Smart water strategy can help us balance supply and demand issues, reduce supply chain risk and recover critical minerals that reduce our overreliance on overseas suppliers. We have the opportunity to show the rest of the country and the world how responsible water usage and economic development go hand in hand. And it can start right here, in the Great Lakes region, if we do it right.

supply chain risk,Stellantis and Zeta Energy announce agreement to develop lithium-sulfur EV batteries - Weekly Voice,Weekly Voice,https://weeklyvoice.com/stellantis-and-zeta-energy-announce-agreement-to-develop-lithium-sulfur-ev-batteries/,"Stellantis N.V. and Zeta Energy Corp. today announced a joint development agreement aimed at advancing battery cell technology for electric vehicle applications. The partnership aims to develop lithium-sulfur EV batteries with game-changing gravimetric energy density while achieving a volumetric energy density comparable to today's lithium-ion technology.

For customers, this means potentially a significantly lighter battery pack with the same usable energy as contemporary lithium-ion batteries, enabling greater range, improved handling and enhanced performance. Additionally, the technology has the potential to improve fast-charging speed by up to 50%, making EV ownership even more convenient. Lithium-sulfur batteries are expected to cost less than half the price per kWh of current lithium-ion batteries.

""Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,"" said Ned Curic, Stellantis Chief Engineering and Technology Officer. ""Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis' commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.""

""We are very excited to be working with Stellantis on this project,"" said Tom Pilette, CEO of Zeta Energy. ""The combination of Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur battery technology with Stellantis' unrivaled expertise in innovation, global manufacturing and distribution can dramatically improve the performance and cost profile of electric vehicles while increasing the supply chain resiliency for batteries and EVs.""

The batteries will be produced using waste materials and methane, with significantly lower CO2 emissions than any existing battery technology. Zeta Energy battery technology is intended to be manufacturable within existing gigafactory technology and would leverage a short, entirely domestic supply chain in Europe or North America.

The collaboration includes both pre-production development and planning for future production. Upon completion of the project, the batteries are targeted to power Stellantis electric vehicles by 2030.

Lithium-sulfur battery technology delivers higher performance at a lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur, being widely available and cost-effective, reduces both production expenses and supply-chain risk. Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur batteries utilize waste materials, methane and unrefined sulfur, a byproduct from various industries, and do not require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel.

Developing high-performing and affordable EVs is a key pillar of Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, which includes offering more than 75 battery electric vehicle models. Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown
supply chain risk,Netacea lands £4M to deploy AI in the battle against bot fraud  --  TFN,Tech Funding News,https://techfundingnews.com/netacea-lands-4m-to-deploy-ai-in-the-battle-against-bot-fraud/,"Netacea, a UK-headquartered cybersecurity specialist that helps companies prevent online fraud by protecting them against bot attacks, has raised a further £4 million. The investment came from Mercia Asset Management, which is investing from its own funds and the first Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund (NPIF) that backed Little Journey and Exciting Instruments.

This follows the $12 million funding raised back in 2022. The latest investment will help Manchester-based Netacea to further extend its AI roadmap, expand its product range and continue its growth.

Online bots account for over half of all fraud cases, with their growing sophistication fueled by advances in offensive AI. These bots can exploit vulnerabilities faster and more effectively than traditional cybersecurity measures can counter.

Founded in 2022 as a spin-out from Intechnica Holdings by Jeremy Gidlow and Andy Still, Netacea's AI-powered platform not only prevents live attacks but also predicts and preempts future threats. Recognising the escalating threat of bot-driven online fraud, the team identified a gap in existing cybersecurity solutions.

After Intechnica's acquisition by US-based Crosslake Technologies, Netacea became a standalone entity, retaining its investors and doubling down on its mission to combat bot-related fraud.

Netacea's technology stands out with its fifth-generation AI, capable of mapping the lifecycle of cyberattacks. The platform detects and mitigates against bot attacks that target mobile, website, and API applications. Netacea's unique agentless approach does not require code to be inserted on customers' web pages, allowing it to stay hidden from attackers while also protecting mobile apps and APIs.

The company's proprietary BLADE framework provides businesses with a comprehensive view of an attack from its initial planning stages to the eventual monetisation of stolen data or products. This open-source framework is gaining traction as a standard tool for security teams globally.

As bots become an increasingly pressing threat, this proactive approach to cybersecurity positions it as a key player in protecting businesses worldwide.

Mick Bradley, CEO of Netacea, said: ""The cost of online fraud is rising at an alarming rate and with the growth of e-commerce and adoption of offensive AI, is estimated to reach $7.95 trillion by 2027. Solving this problem is not only about stopping attacks but also understanding the intent, planning, and execution.

Additionally, the technology has the potential to improve fast-charging speed by up to 50%, making EV ownership even more convenient. Lithium-sulfur batteries are expected to cost less than half the price per kWh of current lithium-ion batteries.

""Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,"" said Ned Curic, Stellantis Chief Engineering and Technology Officer. ""Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis' commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.""

""We are very excited to be working with Stellantis on this project,"" said Tom Pilette, CEO of Zeta Energy. ""The combination of Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur battery technology with Stellantis' unrivaled expertise in innovation, global manufacturing and distribution can dramatically improve the performance and cost profile of electric vehicles while increasing the supply chain resiliency for batteries and EVs.""

The batteries will be produced using waste materials and methane, with significantly lower CO2 emissions than any existing battery technology. Zeta Energy battery technology is intended to be manufacturable within existing gigafactory technology and would leverage a short, entirely domestic supply chain in Europe or North America.

The collaboration includes both pre-production development and planning for future production. Upon completion of the project, the batteries are targeted to power Stellantis electric vehicles by 2030.

Lithium-sulfur battery technology delivers higher performance at a lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur, being widely available and cost-effective, reduces both production expenses and supply-chain risk. Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur batteries utilize waste materials, methane and unrefined sulfur, a byproduct from various industries, and do not require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel.

Developing high-performing and affordable EVs is a key pillar of Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, which includes offering more than 75 battery electric vehicle models. Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown
supply chain risk,"AI uses so much water. If Midwest wants tech growth, let's plan to sustain it. | Opinion",Journal Sentinel,https://eu.jsonline.com/story/opinion/2024/12/06/microsoft-quantum-ev-chips-lake-michigan-water-wisconsin/76455710007/,"Take a flight around the Microsoft Corp. data center campus construction site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin as construction continues.

The Midwest is on the brink of a new economic era. Once a manufacturing stronghold, the Great Lakes region is poised to lead again, fueled by fresh industrial investments like Microsoft's $3.3 billion AI hub in Wisconsin and the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, backed by $1.6 billion in initial investment. The IQMP will be home to company operations for PsiQuantum as well as a quantum proving ground and quantum education programs.

Our economic strength isn't just about people, logistics or markets -- it's also about water. With 20% of the world's fresh water, the Great Lakes region's future hinges on smart, sustainable water strategies to support booming industries like EV batteries, quantum computing and semiconductor chip manufacturing, and data centers.

While the United States leads the world in chip innovation, we lag in manufacturing: more than 90% of chips are made overseas. Serious chips shortages in 2021 underscored how dependent global industry is on key suppliers like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Reducing that supply chain risk is a major reason for the push to accelerate domestic chip manufacturing amid rising demand, driven in large part by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In fact, a semiconductor facility in Michigan within the Great Lakes watershed is under construction in Michigan.

But semiconductor manufacturing has a water problem it has to solve first. The average chip manufacturing facility can use 10 million gallons of ultrapure water per day, the equivalent usage of 33,000 US households. And it's not just water in, but also water out: chip manufacturing also produces wastewater, polluted with heavy metals and other contaminants. Data centers use massive amounts of water and energy for cooling; a 2021 report from Virginia Tech researchers unpacked these needs in great detail.

Great Lakes region can leverage its freshwater advantage

Regions facing water shortages struggle to combat water supply issues. By contrast, the Great Lakes region can harness our freshwater advantage to attract investment and high-quality jobs that drive economic growth.

But we can only do it if we are intentional, strategic, and focused on the long-term sustainability and quality of our water. Otherwise, we risk draining the advantage that sustains our industry and communities.

There are at least two essential parts to smart water strategy. The first is a shift in water reuse strategy. Industrial users rely on water for fabrication, cooling and washing; wastewater could be used for tasks that currently use but don't require clean drinking water.

The second part is changing our reclamation strategy. Conventional wastewater flushes valuable resources down the drain and leaves harmful contaminants behind. Smart, sustainable water strategy takes a different approach, focusing on selective separation of contaminants like heavy metals and forever chemicals and resource recovery of valuable minerals like lithium, nickel and cobalt. This means we can reuse more wastewater, lessen the impact on the environment and reduce our dependence on critical minerals from overseas.

Resource recovery technologies and processes aren't pie in the sky: they're real, available to deploy today, and we're making continual strides to innovate for tomorrow. But we need more industry leaders to adopt them and policymakers to support them, especially here in the Great Lakes, where our leadership on reuse and reclamation can lag behind places facing conditions of water scarcity.

Grant will help us learn how to manage precious water resources

It's the premise behind Current and Great Lakes ReNEW, which in January was awarded up to $160 million over 10 years by the National Science Foundation precisely to lead such innovation in resource recovery. Our engine was selected in large part because the NSF understands that supporting growth in water-intensive industries like semiconductor chip manufacturing and quantum computing is of strategic national importance.

And with a six-state coalition with more than 50 partners, we're working with utilities, industry and research institutions to accelerate progress, including a growing coalition with shared interest in policies that encourage and incentivize smarter strategies for water use and reuse.

Smart water strategy can help us balance supply and demand issues, reduce supply chain risk and recover critical minerals that reduce our overreliance on overseas suppliers. We have the opportunity to show the rest of the country and the world how responsible water usage and economic development go hand in hand. And it can start right here, in the Great Lakes region, if we do it right.

supply chain risk,Mitratech: A Conversation With GRC Solutions Executive Director Alastair Parr On Driving Technology Innovation,Pulse 2.0,https://pulse2.com/mitratech-profile-alastair-parr-interview/,"Mitratech is a global technology leader empowering corporate legal, risk and compliance, and HR professionals to maximize productivity, control expense, and mitigate risk by deepening operational alignment and increasing collaboration and visibility across their organization. Pulse 2.0 interviewed Mitratech's Executive Director of GRC Solutions, Alastair Parr, to learn more about the company.

Can you tell us about your professional background? Parr said:

""I bring over 15 years of experience in product management, consultancy, and operations. I ensure that customer and market demands are thoughtfully integrated and applied innovatively within the Mitratech solution portfolio. My background is in governance, risk, and compliance, where I've developed and implemented solutions to address the increasingly complex challenges in risk management.""

What are the company's core products and features? Parr explained:

""Mitratech's Governance, Risk and Compliance suite offers end-to-end, top-to-bottom risk and compliance management capabilities, spanning:

Whether organizations are just starting to implement GRC processes or looking to deploy next-generation programs across their full enterprise, Mitratech simplifies the process with cross-industry applications, convenient out-of-the-box templates, and relevant analytics to empower data-driven business outcomes. Mitratech also offers a full suite of Corporate Legal and HR Compliance offerings.""

ESG Monitoring Feature

With ESG compliance becoming a growing priority for regulators and investors, how does Mitratech's new ESG monitoring feature help companies uphold sustainability standards throughout their supply chains? Parr emphasized:

""Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, such as measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have surely emerged as a key priority among companies, investors, and government regulators. Measuring GHG emissions involves focusing on direct emissions and extending attention to indirect emissions throughout the supply chain, where scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions come into play. As more governments legislate ESG and sustainability regulations, companies must sift through mountains of ESG reporting data to meet supply chain compliance requirements.

The Mitratech solution includes new capabilities that enhance ESG and sustainability monitoring and correlate with the results of questionnaire-based ESG risk assessments to standardize and simplify global ESG compliance reporting across your supply chain.

The latest release includes:

-- Globally sourced, standards-based data from a recognized leader in ESG and sustainability reporting.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news, and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

-- A comprehensive library of global sustainability questionnaires with built-in remediation guidance to benchmark reporting.

-- A centralized risk register of assessment results and sustainability data for investigation, triage, and task and event management.

By comprehensively understanding and managing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, companies can mitigate supply chain and reputational risks, meet stakeholder expectations, improve operational efficiency, and gain a competitive edge.""

Designing New Risk Management Tools

In light of this year's high-profile supply chain incidents, what insights did Mitratech apply in designing these new risk management tools? Parr replied:

""Our annual TPRM study showed that 61% of companies reported a third-party breach in 2023 - up nearly 50% in the last year and 3x since 2021. Due to growing supplier populations (often global), organizations are often unable to consistently visualize where their data goes and where proprietary or sensitive data can easily be shared with suppliers and subcontractors. What's more, third-party breaches are among the most expensive for organizations to recover from. Data from the 2024 IBM/Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach Report shows that third-party breaches are the third highest predictor of increased breach costs, increasing costs by 5% above the average.

The latest enhancements are meant to address growing supplier complexity by:

-- Quickly identifying vendors potentially at risk of a software supply chain disruption, reducing risk and speeding up the resolution process.

-- Reducing the time required to analyze the impact of supply chain events.

-- Improving supply chain risk visibility and saving time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence and controversies fully aligned with other enterprise risks.

-- Reducing the time required to populate new assessments, speeding risk analysis and remediation.""

Insights About ESG Scores For Suppliers

Sustainability and ESG have emerged as essential metrics for evaluating vendor relationships. Could you provide insights into the specific ESG criteria Mitratech's platform leverages to assess and score suppliers? Parr noted:

""The Mitratech solution provides insights into several ESG metrics.

-- Globally sourced, standards-based data from a recognized leader in ESG and sustainability reporting.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

Data is presented over time, and with it users can compare suppliers against:

With the solution, procurement and supply chain teams can improve supply chain visibility and consistency and save time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence, and controversies, fully aligned with other enterprise risks.""

Evolution Of Mitratech's Technology

How has the company's technology evolved since launching? Parr replied:

""We first introduced our ESG capabilities in 2020 and have since added deeper Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions tracking, overall ESG score enrichment, and ESG controversy tracking to our library of ESG questionnaires, enabling organizations to keep pace with the ever-changing ESG regulatory landscape. As supply chains grow and become more complex, it's essential that organizations centrally track all of their supply chain risks - from cyber disruptions to operational, ESG, and reputational challenges. Our view is that our solution should become the single source of truth for all third-party vendor and supplier risks, which feeds into the overall GRC solution to manage enterprise risks.""

Significant Milestones

What have been some of the company's most significant milestones? Parr cited:

The Midwest is on the brink of a new economic era. Once a manufacturing stronghold, the Great Lakes region is poised to lead again, fueled by fresh industrial investments like Microsoft's $3.3 billion AI hub in Wisconsin and the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, backed by $1.6 billion in initial investment. The IQMP will be home to company operations for PsiQuantum as well as a quantum proving ground and quantum education programs.

Our economic strength isn't just about people, logistics or markets -- it's also about water. With 20% of the world's fresh water, the Great Lakes region's future hinges on smart, sustainable water strategies to support booming industries like EV batteries, quantum computing and semiconductor chip manufacturing, and data centers.

While the United States leads the world in chip innovation, we lag in manufacturing: more than 90% of chips are made overseas. Serious chips shortages in 2021 underscored how dependent global industry is on key suppliers like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Reducing that supply chain risk is a major reason for the push to accelerate domestic chip manufacturing amid rising demand, driven in large part by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In fact, a semiconductor facility in Michigan within the Great Lakes watershed is under construction in Michigan.

But semiconductor manufacturing has a water problem it has to solve first. The average chip manufacturing facility can use 10 million gallons of ultrapure water per day, the equivalent usage of 33,000 US households. And it's not just water in, but also water out: chip manufacturing also produces wastewater, polluted with heavy metals and other contaminants. Data centers use massive amounts of water and energy for cooling; a 2021 report from Virginia Tech researchers unpacked these needs in great detail.

Great Lakes region can leverage its freshwater advantage

Regions facing water shortages struggle to combat water supply issues. By contrast, the Great Lakes region can harness our freshwater advantage to attract investment and high-quality jobs that drive economic growth.

But we can only do it if we are intentional, strategic, and focused on the long-term sustainability and quality of our water. Otherwise, we risk draining the advantage that sustains our industry and communities.

There are at least two essential parts to smart water strategy. The first is a shift in water reuse strategy. Industrial users rely on water for fabrication, cooling and washing; wastewater could be used for tasks that currently use but don't require clean drinking water.

The second part is changing our reclamation strategy. Conventional wastewater flushes valuable resources down the drain and leaves harmful contaminants behind. Smart, sustainable water strategy takes a different approach, focusing on selective separation of contaminants like heavy metals and forever chemicals and resource recovery of valuable minerals like lithium, nickel and cobalt. This means we can reuse more wastewater, lessen the impact on the environment and reduce our dependence on critical minerals from overseas.

Resource recovery technologies and processes aren't pie in the sky: they're real, available to deploy today, and we're making continual strides to innovate for tomorrow. But we need more industry leaders to adopt them and policymakers to support them, especially here in the Great Lakes, where our leadership on reuse and reclamation can lag behind places facing conditions of water scarcity.

Grant will help us learn how to manage precious water resources

It's the premise behind Current and Great Lakes ReNEW, which in January was awarded up to $160 million over 10 years by the National Science Foundation precisely to lead such innovation in resource recovery. Our engine was selected in large part because the NSF understands that supporting growth in water-intensive industries like semiconductor chip manufacturing and quantum computing is of strategic national importance.

And with a six-state coalition with more than 50 partners, we're working with utilities, industry and research institutions to accelerate progress, including a growing coalition with shared interest in policies that encourage and incentivize smarter strategies for water use and reuse.

Smart water strategy can help us balance supply and demand issues, reduce supply chain risk and recover critical minerals that reduce our overreliance on overseas suppliers. We have the opportunity to show the rest of the country and the world how responsible water usage and economic development go hand in hand.

supply chain risk,Global Electronic Components Distributors: Connecting Innovation Worldwide,TechBullion,https://techbullion.com/global-electronic-components-distributors-connecting-innovation-worldwide/,"Electronic component distributors have assumed an essential role in today's rapidly evolving technology. Such a need arises because as new technologies develop, these distributors give life to ideas and businesses by providing the components needed. This article describes how global electronic components distributors are bolstering rise in innovation, improving the efficiency of supply chains, and fostering technological development.

How Global Electronic Components Distributors Changing Strategies Towards the Delivery of Components

The demand for electronic components varies, but an electronic component distributors distribution model enables a consistent demand-supply symbiosis. Today's electronic components distributor help fill the relatively low supply of technology and complex devices required by various industries from sourcing, waiting in the long supply chains, caring about the quality and especially the technical support of devices to the integration into the systems.

Electronic component distributors cover distances and continents to procure parts and deliver them to their customers in other sectors. These businesses engage in more than simply delivering goods; they also manage stock, ensure quality control, and provide technical assistance so that their clientele can innovate without being concerned about supply chain disruption.

Promoting Creativity and New Ideas

Technological advancement in automotive, healthcare, telecommunications, and consumer electronics industries is the main driving force behind the growing demand for electronic components around the globe. Distribution partners fulfill such demands by ensuring prompt availability of the necessary components for new inventions.

Such reconfiguration in the automobile segment toward electric and autonomous vehicles has created a surge in demand for advanced sensors, processors, and connectivity modules. To meet these requirements, global electronic components distributors have developed strong supply chains in order to provide a specialized variety of components to automotive manufacturers.

Healthcare domain equally tends to experience an increasing demand for medical devices and wearables too. These equipment are dependent on minuscule electronic components which are being distributed for purchasing thanks to the deftness of distributors. As a result of the ability to produce such life-saving devices, distributors of electronic components play a positive role in global health and wellness.

Addressing Supply Chain Issues

The COVID-19 pandemic and the latest geopolitical issues have shown the weak points of global supply chains. Supply chain disruptions like parts supplies, which are scarce, and transport delays have hitherto demonstrated how valued reliable and agile distributors would be. Relying on global electronic components distributors has proved to be sustainable on solutions such as supplier bases diversifications, information technologies in inventory management, and construction of regional distribution centers.

Moreover, several distributors have taken up digitalisation as a solution to the challenges posed by supply chains. Virtual platforms and e-commerce solutions now enable customers to check stock, place orders, and even trace shipments and delivery timelines. Such visibility and ease improves the relationship built between distributors and customers while providing long-term attachment.

The Advancement of Technology in Distribution

How various electronic components are distributed around the globe Is now becoming controlled by technology. Advanced software solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) Have now become part and parcel of the operations of electronic components distributors. Predictive systems assist in demand forecasting, planning inventory to optimal levels, and supply chain risk and disruption.

Similarly, AI-enabled analytics enhance the ability of the components distributors to see which items will be in great demand in the future. So they can purchase them ahead of time to avoid running out In this way, businesses relying on the components can conduct business uninterrupted.

In addition, the use of automation in warehouses operates to improve the speed and efficiency of order processing, reception, and dispatch. Automated mechanisms can help to sort, pack, and ship orders which minimizes chances of error and maximizes customer satisfaction.

Sustainability in Distribution

The need and focus for sustainability have in the modern day prevailed in the core industrial sectors across the world such as the electronics sector. distributors on the other hand are practicing the use of biodegradable packaging for distribution to reduce degradation to the environment. By utilizing recyclable packaging materials and minimizing transportation distances' carbon emissions, distributors are contributing towards making the world greener.

Some distributors are also focusing on manufacturers that use sustainable practices. They are from the perspective of the manufacturers' ecologic footprint, promoting energy-efficient components usage and obsolete electronic parts recycling, thus advancing circular economy within the industry.

The Future of Electronic Components Distribution

Diversification of industries is characteristic for the development and the same applies to that of electronic components distributors. With the increasing use of emerging technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, new demands for specific components will arise. In this regard, it will be necessary to adapt to the trends by broadening the range of items in the product portfolio and improving the level of technical knowledge.

Moreover, the emergences of regional hubs will force the distributors to change their logistics strategy. The construction of local warehouses and distribution centres allows the businesses to meet the demands of local customers at lower transport expenses and shorter delivery time.

The shift towards customer experience is, however, expected to continue. The distributors that deploy modern systems and treat consumers personally are in the competitive edge. This encompasses providing kitted items and other components for complex projects supplemented with undertaking technical assistance.

Conclusion

The electronic components distributor in the global scope are in the epicenter of the ongoing industrial revolution and changing the systems for industries and manufacturers. Their function is quite beyond just providing components; they are enablers of progressive actions so that opportunities are explored and innovation is performed.

These distributors continue to be a profound player in the distribution of electronics by adopting technology, embedding ecological considerations and adjusting to emerging conditions. From facilitating the development and manufacture of self- vehicle systems to the latest gadgets the contributions of electronic components distributors cannot be exaggerated.

supply chain risk,Financial sector warns prolonged political turmoil will hurt Korea's economy,중앙일보,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-12-06/business/finance/Financial-sector-warns-prolonged-political-turmoil-will-hurt-Koreas-economy/2194770,"Fitch Ratings, one of the world's largest credit rating agencies, expected that the ongoing political turmoil, if prolonged, may amplify downside risks for Korea's sovereign credit rating.

While noting that the impact of President Yoon Suk Yeol's emergency martial law declaration on the market has been limited, the firm suggested that political volatility may exacerbate downward pressure for the export-driven economy, which has already been facing a slowdown amid rising U.S. policy uncertainties.

In a release issued on Friday, Fitch said that the ongoing political uncertainties ""will not materially and durably undermine institutional quality or threaten the economic and external finance credit strengths underpinning the sovereign's AA-/Stable rating.""

The financial market risks ""appear manageable, with initial pressures on the exchange rate and financial conditions having eased following the swift rescinding of martial law and a proactive response from the Bank of Korea and Ministry of Economy and Finance,"" noted the agency.

Korea's previous two impeachment trials also did not impose major damage on the country's sovereign credit profile, it said.

However, the credit agency also highlighted, ""Downside risks would increase in the event of a protracted political crisis or if sustained political divisions erode policymaking effectiveness, economic outcomes or fiscal management.""

The martial law declaration, albeit short-lived, ""could hurt investor perceptions of political risk,"" noted Fitch, adding, ""recent events also highlight stresses within the political system.""

The firm pointed out that the Korean economy already faces trade risks stemming from the incoming Donald Trump administration's protectionist policy proposals, while also citing ""widespread"" labor strikes triggered by the martial law incident as a potential risk factor that may hamper economic activity.

S&P Global Ratings expressed a similar view, suggesting that the recent events could undermine investment sentiment for overseas companies.

Before the martial law declaration, ""risk in Korea in that kind of [political] matter really wasn't on companies' minds,"" said Andy Liu, S&P Global Ratings' managing director of corporate ratings in the Asia-Pacific region, during a news conference in western Seoul on Wednesday.

""Given that it happened, it will probably cause some of the [corporations] to think about and re-evaluate supply chain risk, financial risk, policy risks,"" Liu suggested.

But the firm projected that the incident would not have an impact on the country's sovereign rating.

Moody's Ratings also expected that the ongoing political chaos will undermine the government's administrative ability and function amid slowing growth potential, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.

As companies seek to enter new markets, adapt to changes in existing markets, and face the reality that disruption and change are here to stay, they must reckon with the fact that traditional supply chain risk management practices will need to adapt and evolve. The traditional tradeoffs will no longer serve supply chain organizations. Supply chains and networks used to prioritize cost, service, and cash tradeoffs above all else, but now they must also factor in risk and resilience.

Supply chains must be stress tested, examined for potential points of failure and points of resilience, and suppliers must be assessed for risk at the point of decision, not after the fact. These tasks are impossible without the assistance of a digital model of the physical supply chain. A digital model, or digital supply chain twin, allows organizations to perform these stress tests virtually so they can feel confident about how changes and disruptions and risks will impact their physical supply chains in advance.

And it is not enough to run these analyses once or twice a year. Instead, organizations must conduct supply chain modeling on a continuous basis.

In this publication, we will dive deeper into these issues and establish a framework.

supply chain risk,Stellantis and Zeta Energy Announce Agreement to Develop Lithium-Sulfur EV Batteries | Business Upturn,Business Upturn,https://www.businessupturn.com/brand-post/stellantis-and-zeta-energy-announce-agreement-to-develop-lithium-sulfur-ev-batteries/,"Stellantis and Zeta Energy Announce Agreement to Develop Lithium-Sulfur EV Batteries

Amsterdam and Houston, TX - December 5, 2024 - Stellantis N.V. and Zeta Energy Corp. today announced a joint development agreement aimed at advancing battery cell technology for electric vehicle applications. The partnership aims to develop lithium-sulfur EV batteries with game-changing gravimetric energy density while achieving a volumetric energy density comparable to today's lithium-ion technology.

For customers, this means potentially a significantly lighter battery pack with the same usable energy as contemporary lithium-ion batteries, enabling greater range, improved handling and enhanced performance. Additionally, the technology has the potential to improve fast-charging speed by up to 50%, making EV ownership even more convenient. Lithium-sulfur batteries are expected to cost less than half the price per kWh of current lithium-ion batteries.

""Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,"" said Ned Curic, Stellantis Chief Engineering and Technology Officer. ""Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis' commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.""

""We are very excited to be working with Stellantis on this project,"" said Tom Pilette, CEO of Zeta Energy. ""The combination of Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur battery technology with Stellantis' unrivaled expertise in innovation, global manufacturing and distribution can dramatically improve the performance and cost profile of electric vehicles while increasing the supply chain resiliency for batteries and EVs.""

The batteries will be produced using waste materials and methane, with significantly lower CO emissions than any existing battery technology. Zeta Energy battery technology is intended to be manufacturable within existing gigafactory technology and would leverage a short, entirely domestic supply chain in Europe or North America.

The collaboration includes both pre-production development and planning for future production. Upon completion of the project, the batteries are targeted to power Stellantis electric vehicles by 2030.

Lithium-sulfur battery technology delivers higher performance at a lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur, being widely available and cost-effective, reduces both production expenses and supply-chain risk. Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur batteries utilize waste materials, methane and unrefined sulfur, a byproduct from various industries, and do not require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel.

Developing high-performing and affordable EVs is a key pillar of Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, which includes offering more than 75 battery electric vehicle models. Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies.

Lithium-sulfur battery technology delivers higher performance at a lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur, being widely available and cost-effective, reduces both production expenses and supply-chain risk. Zeta Energy's lithium-sulfur batteries utilize waste materials, methane and unrefined sulfur, a byproduct from various industries, and do not require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel.

Developing high-performing and affordable EVs is a key pillar of Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, which includes offering more than 75 battery electric vehicle models. Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies.

supply chain risk,Frameworks for a Common Operating Procedure for Supply Chain Risk Management Over the Acquisition Life Cycle,Rand Corporation,https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2002-1.html,"Although policy guidance is in place to manage some risks, there is no comprehensive procedure on how to manage the array of risks that can afflict U.S. Army supply chains. Because the Army lacks a comprehensive supply chain risk management (SCRM) system, there is limited ability to proactively identify and manage supply chain risks across a weapon system program's life cycle. In this report, the authors develop frameworks to support implementation of an Army common operating procedure for identifying and managing supply chain risks during the acquisition life cycle.

The authors surveyed the SCRM literature to catalog and define 10 supply chain risk categories and 31 supply chain risk drivers. They also documented lessons learned from three supply chain risk case studies. The authors reviewed the process steps and documents reflected in the Army acquisition life cycle; interviewed representatives from the acquisition and sustainment communities to understand the existing approach to SCRM; and then identified the steps along the process where supply chain risk activities might take place.

The authors recommend the adoption of three interconnected SCRM frameworks that span the weapon system's life cycle. By managing across three frameworks, the Army can focus SCRM activities within the organizations that have the most knowledge and information about the weapon system at that point in the life cycle. The interrelated nature of the frameworks promotes sharing knowledge and acknowledging the changing nature of risks across the life cycle.",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

Vancouver, BC, Canada, December 5, 2024 - TheNewswire - First Tellurium Corp. (CSE: FTEL, OTC: FSTTF) reports that Fenix Advanced Materials (Fenix), a world leader in the supply of ultra-high purity metals, has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with First Tellurium's 75% owned subsidiary PyroDelta Energy Corp (PyroDelta) to be the preferred supplier of tellurium and other critical metals for manufacture of PyroDelta's thermoelectric generators. As previously reported by First Tellurium, PyroDelta is developing thermoelectric generators that offer significant advantages over thermoelectric devices currently on the market, including far higher heat tolerances, lighter weight and more robust construction.

""We're very excited about the broad market potential for PyroDelta's thermoelectric technology,"" said Fenix CEO Don Freschi. ""Our intent is to ensure they have a stable, North American supply of all the critical metals required to succeed long term.""

As part of the LOI agreement, Fenix will also provide other technical or materials support, as required, to help PyroDelta bring the generators to market and sustain ongoing manufacturing and sales. Fenix, based in Trail, British Columbia, is one of few suppliers in the world producing metals with purities as high as 99.99995%.

""This agreement marks a crucial step in development and manufacturing for PyroDelta as we progress towards securing our initial sales,"" said First Tellurium President and CEO Tyrone Docherty. ""We're especially pleased to be using a domestic critical metals supplier, greatly reducing our chances for supply disruption and keeping the business within North America.""

Docherty noted that, considering China's December 3rd announcement that it would begin banning the export of certain rare minerals to the United States, securing domestic supplies of critical metals becomes more important.

""China is the world's largest producer of tellurium, by far,"" said Docherty. ""And while China hasn't yet indicated intent to restrict tellurium exports, they have that leverage and could certainly use it as this trade war expands. The thermoelectric device requires other critical metals, as well, that could be affected with the latest export bans. In any event, we want to reduce our supply-chain risk while we can.""

PyroDelta is presently focused on building thermoelectric generators for the automobile industry, developing a device designed to replace alternators in combustion engines and offer significant savings in fuel consumption. Concurrently, PyroDelta is also developing compact, silent and portable generators for the emergency and recreational industries as well as for agriculture and drone use in industry and defense.

Cancellation of Annual General Meeting

First Tellurium also announces that it has cancelled its Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for December 31, 2024, and it has been granted an extension by BC Registrar of Companies due to the ongoing Canada Post strike action. The Company plans to hold its meeting in Q2 2025 and will advise shareholders when a new date has been scheduled.

About First Tellurium Corp.

First Tellurium's unique business model is to generate revenue and value through mineral discovery, project development, project generation and development of tellurium-based technologies.

First Tellurium is listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange under the symbol ""FTEL"" and on the OTC under the symbol ""FSTTF"". Further information about FTEL and its projects can be found at www.firsttellurium.com.

supply chain risk,Twinset integrates AI-powered platform to strengthen supply chain traceability,retail-systems.com,https://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Twinset_integrates_ai_powered_platform_to_strengthen_supply_chain_traceability.php,"Italian high-end fashion brand Twinset has integrated an AI-powered platform to strengthen the traceability of its supply chain and expand its environmental impact initiatives.

The new platform, integrated in collaboration with global Saas specialist TrusTrace, aims to help identify suppliers, support eco-design initiatives, and measure the environmental impact of each product.

The technology aims to help the brand collect and validate primary data from its supply chains to strengthen environmentally led solutions. The data can be used for risk management, compliance, product claims, and footprint calculations, enabling the firm to share data on product origin and impact.

Silvia Zaganelli, traceability and business development manager at Twinset said: ""We are implementing the platform as the backbone of our three-year traceability programme, which is ambitioning to discover sub-suppliers, map and collect data for key value processes, and achieve PO-level traceability.""

As part of a three-year roadmap, the company aims to gather data and progressively scale up to ultimately trace the full range of product categories and suppliers.

The brand said it is particularly focused on identifying material country of origin, managing supply-chain risk such as forced labour, and enabling eco-design by assessing the environmental impact of the product.

The brand is also preparing for incoming regulations such as Digital Product Passports (DDPs) which will be mandatory on textiles sold in Europe by 2030 and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires companies to report on their environmental and social impact.",,,,N/A,N/A,PO
supply chain risk,SAP BrandVoice: The Critical Role Of The Humanitarian Supply Chain,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/12/05/the-critical-role-of-the-humanitarian-supply-chain/,"Most people think of the global supply chain as a commercial process to ship products to consumers. However, there is also a humanitarian supply chain that is relatively unknown to many. And given the current geopolitical, economic and ecological crises, it is more important than ever.

According to the UN, 362 million people depend on humanitarian aid, a new record.

This increased dependence has pushed humanitarian organizations to provide even more support to the most vulnerable areas of the world.

Humanitarian supply chain management encompasses all activities related to the preparation and management of the relief goods and services needed in crisis situations such as natural disasters or conflicts.

And in view of the fact that new disasters, such as the recent severe weather disasters in Florida or Spain, and the humanitarian impacts of wars and violence in places such as Haiti and Gaza, this topic is of particularly relevance. The recent global increase in demand for humanitarian aid organizations has spotlighted just how important their work is.

If you'd like to learn more about the humanitarian supply chain, listen to ""The Future of Supply Chain"" podcast HERE.

In light of this development, it seems all the more important to learn more about this particular form of supply chain and to learn from the humanitarian supply chain for the commercial supply chain. What makes the supply chain so special for organizations and companies alike? Where are the similarities, where are the differences, and in which areas can the different supply chains benefit from each other?

The objectives of commercial and humanitarian supply chains could hardly be more different: On the one hand, the focus is on maximizing profits and minimizing costs, while on the other, saving lives is the top priority. But despite these differences, cost reduction plays a central role in both approaches.

As Prof. Dr. Maria Besiou emphasizes in a recent ""The Future of Supply Chain"" podcast episode, ""From Disaster Relief to Business Strategy: Humanitarian Supply Chain Insights"", ""that the time to respond is very critical, but at the same time, the cost is also very important because if I can save cost, if I can be more efficient in the way that I'm running my operations, then I can reach a bigger part of the population in need with the same budget."" And this idea can also be applied to commercial supply chains.

According to Gartner, logistics costs account for a significant proportion of total supply chain management spend, in some organizations it is almost 80%. It is therefore not surprising that companies are looking for ways to reduce logistics costs in the supply chain.

The latest technologies such as AI or ML have great potential for reducing costs. With the help of an AI-supported transport management system, transport routes can be optimized to not only shorten the distance travelled but also reduce fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions. This leads to lower transport costs and also makes an important contribution to sustainability. Minimizing costs and increasing efficiency go hand in hand with ecological and economic benefits.

Supply chains are currently at the center of attention more than ever and are facing a number of major challenges. Pandemic, war, lack of resources and technological disruptions are affecting global trade.

And this unpredictability, especially in times of crisis, is well known in the humanitarian supply chain. According to Prof. Dr. Besiou, organizations are used to work in difficult locations where government regulations are constantly changing. And it is this element of uncertainty that the organizations are incorporating.

""Now, there are different strategies for preparedness, that humanitarian organizations have been using for a while, and these are also strategies that are very typical in risk management for commercial companies,"" says Besiou.

Resilience in the commercial supply chain has become increasingly important in recent years, especially since the coronavirus pandemic exposed the vulnerability of global supply chains. As a result, risk management has increasingly become the focus of many companies, who now recognize the need to adapt quickly to unforeseen disruptions.

With the help of AI-driven solutions, companies can now not only shorten their supply chain risk management cycle times, but also increase their ROI through improved process visibility, real-time decision making through scenario planning and risk assessment and automated approval controls, enabling them to respond quickly to potential disruptions and thus maintain their operational resilience.

Close cooperation between different actors is necessary in both supply chains. Humanitarian organizations and companies need to communicate and coordinate with suppliers, partners and other stakeholders to achieve their goals. This cooperation is crucial for minimizing redundancies and maximizing efficiency.

But what is ultimately important for both supply chains is, as Prof. Dr. Besiou sums up: ""The humanitarian sector does not need only funding. Yes, it needs resources, but also different kinds of resources. It needs knowledge. It needs skills. It needs openness.""

In addition, qualified specialist personnel who are proficient in the use of new technology are essential in order to remain competitive in the long term.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Gaza, Haiti, AI, Florida, Spain"
supply chain risk,Recap blog: ALSC Digital Strategies Europe,Automotive Logistics,https://www.automotivelogistics.media/automotive-logistics-and-supply-chain-digital-strategies-europe-insights/recap-blog-alsc-digital-strategies-europe/46453.article,"Catch the key moments from Day 1 in Munich! From diversity and talent forums to cutting-edge AI and robotics, we explored how innovation is transforming the automotive supply chain. Hear insights from BMW, CATL, JLR, and more, and discover what's next in digital strategies.

Don't miss the highlights and stay tuned for more updates from Day 2!

In the final session of this year's ALSC Digital Strategies Europe conference representatives from JLR, Daimler Truck and software service provider Celonis talked about risk-proofing supply and production.

Actions speak louder than words and they also prove the efficacy of an established risk strategy once the more salient dangers are identified, whether they relate to regulatory compliance, geopolitical crises, natural disasters or financial instability. Data transparency is important but that alone cannot help a company.

""We need to have a proper process and consequence management in place,"" said Marion Gillich, head of supplier risk management at Daimler Truck. ""If I know a certain KPI is dropping, then great, I have a look at it and say, yeah, okay, it's dropping, but what do I do with that?""

Daimler Truck has adopted an octopus model to deal with supplier risk from a financial perspective amongst its suppliers and one of the arms Gillich and her team are strengthening is the assessment of supplier sustainability. For the last five years the supplier risk management team has been collecting carbon disclosure project (CDP) scores from its suppliers and creating a report that is sent to Daimler Truck management.

Now it is working on building in consequences should the CDP scores go up or down, and it is making the different risk categories more transparent. Another example of consequence management relates to whether a supplier is in an area of high risk from flooding or other climate-related disruption. ""Here we're working together with our supplier management and logistics counterparts to say, 'hey, we saw that your supplier is in a high-risk area for flooding, can you please check are the right mitigation measures at the supplier in place',"" said Gillich.

Similarly, JLR has processes around data-fed risk detection, which Simon Inskip, director of supply chain digital and innovation at the carmaker, described as a sensing platform. ""When a risk becomes an issue and it needs management get resolved, then we have processes and mechanisms stepped up to support that,"" he said. ""The data side of things has been a case of evolving while we've had to run at the same time so some of the thinking that we have now for data needs to be retrofitted back to what we've already done. But ultimately those learnings have forced where we need to go in the future as well.""

Inskip said that JLR had to move fast on its risk-sensing capability and is in the second year of full deployment and already the carmaker is looking for greater data granularity and substance from its platform and that means increasing the accuracy of input data. ""When you know, for example, the address and the location of all your tier ones then its happy days,"" said Inskip. ""I get all the risks associated to that location and if there is uncertainty around that, then that uncertainty is played back in the risks that you get as well.""

That level of visibility on risk plays into the demand for end-to-end transparency in the supply chain and as a provider of the technology on which carmakers and tier suppliers depend for that transparency, Celonis is focused on how its software-as-a-service improves processes and operational excellent. That again goes back to opening silos.

""We need to provide a platform that allows for the different silos to be connected with each other so that the data that you have in the silos can be brought into context and you can actually make deductions from it,"" said Julien Thomßen, global automotive and manufacturing industry lead at Celonis. However, while the technology is available, getting approval for its adoption across the board at a company is more tricky.

""It's way harder to get that through the political side of organisations,"" Thomßen acknowledged. ""If you take big end-to-end processes, like the order-to-delivery process in automotive, you have the production lord, you have the sales lord, you have the logistics lord. You might convince one or two but convincing everyone at the same time is much harder.""

Thomßen's advice was to pick your battles and identify the biggest value could be gained. ""Make a point about why that technology is needed and also be humble and honest,"" he said. ""If a simple Power BI dashboard is sufficient, then don't fight because it won't get you anywhere.""

Bolstering the automotive supply chain for the future is not just about the latest technology, it is about culturing a collaborative mindset in a competitive landscape. This afternoon speakers from Seat, Infineon Technologies and battery maker CATL discussed how a shared vision was essential for problem solving and building a resilient supply chain strategy.

A company has to be internally aligned before it can offer value to its customers, according to CATL's Aleksej Kruekov, general manager of overseas service for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) region. By example, Kruekov pointed to the predictive maintenance platform CATL has been running in China for several years that analyses battery and cell performance in real time and provides data on the behaviour of the cells. The data helps identify any abnormalities with which CATL can generate early warning systems. With that he said CATL was able to add value in terms of safety and reliability to the supply partnerships it has with its OEMs.

Maximising OEM satisfaction through more reliable products and services is also important to Infineon Technologies, which makes semiconductors. Providing them to a high standard depends on bridging the functional and data silos within the organisation, which is what Infineon has done according to Fuchs, bringing together sales, marketing, operations and finance step by step. The result is an increase in pace and quality. Fuchs said the aim of that internal collaboration was increasing customer satisfaction and strengthening external partnerships.

Speaking for the OEMs, Alexandre Lerma, manager of logistics and customer driven supply chain at Spanish carmaker Seat, said that working together across departments within the company has proven to improve results, as seen in the internal IT and business alliance behind the carmaker's digitalisation strategy (read more here). That teamwork is now in the mindset at Seat and Lerma said the carmaker is seeing much better results than expected with everyone more engaged and key performance indicators up across the board driving the company forward.

That spirit of collaboration now extends beyond Seat, though Lerma admitted that there have been challenges in convincing suppliers to share data for closer supply chain integration. ""It was hard to gain trust at the beginning but thanks to the early adopters they saw the win-win of sharing the data.. and that has helped us move on to other suppliers that did not want to collaborate who see the results that we are getting.""

Lerma said that the trust Seat has built with its supplier is based on sharing data and being transparent about the common benefits for all.

Now in a panel discussion, Jean-Christophe Deville, vice-president of supply chain, Toyota Motor Europe and Juliana Raidt, head of data privacy and information security, Bosch talk about the human dimension of digitalisation.

Raidt discussed the challenge of helping employees adapt to new tools and processes, stressing the need for robust change management strategies. She noted that Bosch prioritises efficiency gains and upskilling rather than workforce reductions, ensuring employees see digital transformation as an opportunity rather than a threat.

Deville highlighted the dynamic nature of partnerships, and acknowledged that the Velos project's outcomes had deviated from initial expectations, underscoring the importance of adaptability and trust in external partnerships.

In closing, the panel underscored a shared vision: by empowering employees, embracing innovation, and remaining adaptable, automotive companies can thrive in a rapidly evolving industry.

4 December

Juliana Raidt, head of data privacy and information security, Bosch closely followed Jean-Christophe Deville's presentation. She spoke about Bosch's Transport Management System (TMS) which leverages features such as paperless workflows, real-time tracking of trucks, multilingual interfaces for cross-border logistics, and automated registration and security checks.

The system is operational at 39 locations globally, with plans to expand further. This rollout process has required adapting to regional regulations, she said, demonstrating Bosch's commitment to legal compliance and operational flexibility.

Raidt also spoke about the importance of data privacy and cybersecurity, and said it is important to collaborate early with cybersecurity experts to avoid inefficiencies during project rollouts. She said that ensuring data privacy compliance remains a cornerstone of Bosch's strategy, particularly given varying regional regulations, and shared an example of how Bosch had to reject certain localised practices to uphold stringent privacy standards.

In his presentation, Jean-Christophe Deville, vice-president of supply chain at Toyota Motor Europe, shared the OEM's strategy to transition from a survival mode during recent crises to a more systematic and high-performing supply chain model.

Deville talked about two initiatives the carmaker has been implementing in its digital strategy. Toyota Motor Europe has developed Velos planning software in collaboration with Inform to improve visibility and efficiency in vehicle logistics planning. The system offers real-time insights into stock levels, transportation needs, and potential bottlenecks, allowing Toyota and its partners to forecast and allocate resources more effectively. Additionally, he said Velos enables dynamic prioritisation of vehicles, moving beyond the traditional first-in-first-out method to enhance customer satisfaction.

The second initiative Deville mentioned was Toyota's new Megahub in Czech Republic, which was inaugurated last month. He said the Megahub integrates digital instructions to streamline option-fitting processes for vehicles.

We are now breaking for lunch after which we will be back with leaders from Toyota Motor Europe and Bosch to explore the fundamental shifts needed in leadership thinking and organisations to develop a successful digital transformation journey, from digitalising truck transport and vehicle logistics, and adapting change management across stakeholders.

Before the conference closes, we will also hear from experts from Alexandre Lerma, manager of logistics, customer driven supply chain from SEAT, Birgit Fuchs, vice president of supply chain automotive from Infineon Technologies and Aleksej Kruekov, general manager overseas service EMEA from CATL on key steps that can be taken to bring about effective collaboration and talk about how trust can be built, visions can be aligned, and automation can be widespread.

Just before lunch, we welcomed John Torres, lead senior data scientist, Mercedes-Benz; Eric Ramatchandirane, supply chain management IT solutions manager, Autoliv; and Leonid Yanshin, sales executive, supply chain, InterSystems to the stage. In a world of increasing complexity, the automotive leaders from Mercedes-Benz, Autoliv and InterSystems shared their expertise on harnessing data to enhance supply chains.

The panel explored the power of governance, collaboration and advanced analytics to unlock efficiency and agility in a competitive market.

Torres highlighted how fragmented systems hinder data quality and decision-making. Mercedes-Benz's strategy involves consolidating legacy systems and connecting data lakes with a focus on governance. Similarly, Ramatchandirane shared how Autoliv's multi-region operations face challenges with harmonising data from over 60 sites using different ERP systems.

Yanshin emphasised the role of modern tools in breaking silos, advocating for connective layers that allow seamless data exchange across diverse systems while ensuring data validation and enrichment.

A robust data strategy offers significant rewards. Yanshin compared an optimised supply chain to possessing a ""crystal ball and magic wand,"" enabling foresight and automation.

Torres underscored the strategic advantage of connecting data across procurement, logistics, and marketing. This end-to-end visibility enables faster, more informed decisions, crucial in today's volatile environment.

The panel agreed that the journey to a data-driven supply chain requires more collaboration, and said that organisations must align leadership with actionable strategies and foster a culture that values transparency and innovation.

4 December

Trre Wong, senior manager, global supply chain digitalisation, Kautex Textron joined Schaeffler Technologies' Hilgerloh on stage to talk about balancing agility with adherence to governance structures. Hilgerloh noted that a well-defined digitalisation strategy provides a ""target picture"" that helps manage expectations and prevents redundancies. Wong shared an example of collaborative innovation hubs at Kautex Textron, where cross-functional teams work together to tackle shared challenges, such as calculating carbon footprints across the supply chain.

A recurring theme was the importance of addressing knowledge gaps between IT and business units. Both panellists acknowledged the challenges of aligning priorities, with Wong explaining that businesses often demand immediate solutions while IT focuses on long-term governance.

To foster alignment, Schaeffler shifted governance responsibility to business teams, empowering them to collaborate on digital strategies. Meanwhile, Kautex Textron implemented talent development programmes to embed digital literacy across the organisation, allowing departments to co-create innovative solutions that address their specific needs.

The panel concluded with a call to action: digitalisation must be treated as a business-wide initiative. Both Wong and Hilgerloh underscored the need for collaborative environments that connect experts in technology with those who understand operational nuances.

4 December

Tammo Hilgerloh, head of supply chain digitalisation at supplier Schaeffler Technologies, took to the stage this morning to discuss how the company reshaped its logistics to boost efficiency, transparency and sustainability by addressing inefficiencies, enhancing data quality and adopting a modular approach.

With over four million annual deliveries and a nine-figure transportation spend, Schaeffler recognised the need for systemic change to streamline operations and meet strategic objectives such as cost reduction, emissions tracking and lead-time optimisation.

He said that Schaeffler's transportation logistics were fragmented, relying on over 30 disconnected IT systems, manual processes and outdated tools. Hilgerloh likened this fragmented system to a ""Frankenstein's monster"" -- functional but far from optimal. The realisation prompted the development of a cohesive digital strategy that aligned with the company's overarching business goals.

Hilgerloh emphasised starting with the business strategy to ensure digital initiatives addressed core objectives. This involved standardising processes, achieving data transparency by transitioning from manual data exchanges like Excel and emails to API and EDI integrations, enhancing data quality using machine learning, and simulation and optimisation through predictive models to manage risks and evaluate business impacts.

4 December

We are breaking into our first networking break for the day for delegates to discuss the takeaways from the sessions and other trends in the digital automotive logistics landscape.

We will continue with some keynotes and panels from Tammo Hilgerloh, head of supply chain digitalisation from Schaeffler Technologies and Trre Wong from Kautex Textron, who joined us yesterday on stage as well, to talk about developing digital solutions for strategic supply chain objectives.

We will also hear from John Torres, lead senior data scientist at Mercedes-Benz AG, Eric Ramatchandirane, supply chain management IT solutions manager at Autoliv and Leonid Yanshin, sales executive, supply chain at InterSystems on how digital leaders are turning supply chain data into a competitive advantage, whether in anticipating and responding to potential disruption, or in providing suppliers and customers the most accurate, actionable information.

The panel discussion ""Seeing through automotive supply chain blind spots"" brought together experts from JLR, Volkswagen Group and Brose Group to explore challenges and strategies for improving transparency and efficiency in the automotive supply chain.

Agnieszka Kubiak, senior vice president of logistics at Brose Group, emphasised the difficulty of unifying legacy systems and overcoming organisational silos. ""Our blind spots often arise from inconsistent data and process harmonisation,"" she noted, adding that initiatives like Brose's SAP realignment aim to address these gaps.

Building on insights shared during the previous session, ""Co-creative supply chains"", Chmielarz of JLR delved further into the human dimensions of digital transformation during the panel discussion. She emphasised that users often feel ""overwhelmed by new systems and interfaces,"" a challenge JLR is addressing through ""Project Revive"".

Chmielarz reiterated the importance of fostering collaboration through tools like product lifecycle management platforms. Such integration, she explained, not only enhances decision-making but also positions logistics as a strategic contributor within JLR's broader transformation.

Volkswagen's Sommer reinforced the need for a robust master data strategy to ensure supply chain visibility. ""Data consistency is essential, but we must also consider the end-to-end process,"" he explained, advocating for clear ownership of data responsibilities across functions.

The panel also addressed digitalisation challenges in supplier and logistics provider collaboration. Real-time data sharing, while beneficial, must be balanced against practical limitations. ""Sometimes, less is more. Controllers don't need all the data; they need actionable insights,"" said Chmielarz.

The session concluded with a call to action: embrace digitalisation as an integral part of logistics. ""Digitisation is logistics,"" Sommer stated, urging the industry to integrate IT and operational strategies fully.

4 December

Paulina Chmielarz, digital and innovation director of industrial operations at JLR, outlined the company's strides in breaking down silos and fostering enterprise-wide collaboration at the ""Co-creative supply chains"" session. Her presentation highlighted the critical role of fusion teams in bridging business and IT gaps, ensuring seamless integration and effective digitalisation.

""End-to-end digitalisation requires organisations to build cross-functional teams with a mix of technical and business expertise,"" explained Chmielarz. She positioned these fusion teams as the linchpin of JLR's transformation, facilitating collaboration across departments and translating technical solutions into tangible business value.

Watch: JLR's Paulina Chmielarz on how data strategy supports a reimagined supply chain

JLR's progress in integrating product lifecycle management and enterprise resource planning systems serves as a case study. ""We've achieved over 130 use cases with complete end-to-end bill of material integration,"" she noted, adding that this has improved coordination between supply chain and engineering teams, with logistics integration set to follow.

Chmielarz also discussed the findings from ""Project Revive,"" a study designed to understand digital adoption within JLR. ""Through a discovery phase involving hundreds of team members, we learned that leadership endorsement of digital tools is more impactful than training alone,"" she revealed. The project focuses on improving user experience and addressing root causes of low adoption, ensuring digitalisation delivers its intended value.

The transformation extends to managing software changes in supply chains, a historically complex area. Chmielarz highlighted how a software bill of materials enables JLR to track and manage digital assets with the same efficiency as physical parts, eliminating phantom processes.

Concluding, she remarked on the critical interplay of people, processes and governance in sustaining JLR's digital journey. ""The machine is now complete, the machine is moving,"" Chmielarz affirmed, underscoring the tangible results and continued innovation ahead.

4 December

Volkswagen Group's head of information process logistics, Thorsten Sommer, opened with a keynote that focused on supply chain transparency and the integration of data management with AI-driven solutions. Sommer emphasised execution over strategy, offering actionable insights to industry leaders.

""Transparency in the supply chain sounds simple,"" Sommer remarked, ""but challenges such as silo thinking, unharmonised processes and inconsistent data make it a complex goal."" He noted that transparency is not only essential for operational efficiency but is increasingly driven by regulatory demands, including the EU's Deforestation Directive and evolving product passport requirements.

Sommer identified three core obstacles to transparency: organisational fear of exposing inefficiencies, a lack of data quality awareness and technical fragmentation caused by proprietary IT solutions. To address these, he advocated for breaking silo thinking and establishing a cultural shift towards data sharing, supported by centralised management. ""Data management should be centralised wherever possible,"" he said, stressing its role in creating unified standards and reducing redundant maintenance costs.

One of his key recommendations was to ""start small and think big."" Sommer encouraged organisations to leverage existing data before pursuing expansive new datasets. ""Harvest with what you have; each harvest yields seeds for the next,"" he advised, highlighting the importance of balancing efforts between data collection (""sowing"") and application (""reaping"").

Sommer concluded, ""Regulations are not obstacles but boosters for innovation - embrace them to fuel your data strategies.""

4 December

The second day of the Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Digital Strategies Europe 2024 conference opened with a forward-looking exploration of how digitalisation and innovation are reshaping automotive logistics. In Ludwig's welcome remarks, he underscored the significance of these trends: ""Yesterday, we hit on quite a few topics around data strategy, around visibility, certainly around AI and advanced automation. Today, we'll go deeper and challenge some areas in terms of vision versus reality.""

Day two's agenda promises to address pivotal topics, including transparency within and across supply chains. ""Over the next hour and a half, we are going to be looking in depth at some of the really strategic areas of digital transformation in terms of transparency - transparency across the supply chain, within companies, across different departments and cross functions,"" noted Ludwig.

High-profile speakers from industry leaders, including Volkswagen, JLR and Brose Group are scheduled to share their strategies and tackle challenges in visibility, digital transformation and data strategy. One of the goals of today, according to Ludwig is to explore ""what some of the challenges and blind spots are in enhancing this visibility.""

After a day of insightful sessions and workshops on AI, digitalising supply chain, data security, sustainability and real-time discussion on future applications of digital tools from some of the industry's experts, the delegates and speakers attended a networking dinner hosted by Automotive Logistics.

We will be back tomorrow for Day 2 of the conference with more insights from JLR, Volkswagen Group, Brose Group, Mercedes-Benz AG, Toyota Motor Europe, Bosch and many more. Stay tuned!

3rd December

After some workshop brainstorming on a range of subjects that included AI applications, supply chain mapping, data security in sustainability and building digital twins, delegates ALSC Digital Strategies Europe gathered to summarise their findings.

John Torres, lead data scientist at Mercedes-Benz, said there was no shortage of challenges in the sector that AI could help solve but even that took a better shared understanding of where the tool itself needed improvement. There needs to be more data of a better standard that is better structured and better governed, according to Torres.

One of the important things to consider when applying AI tools in the automotive supply chain is the value they have for a company's business. ""It's super important that we are not using AI just for the sake of it but that we actually understand the value behind it,"" said Torres. ""Is it actually solving a problem or is it there just because of the hype?""

Managing expectations and having sponsorship to develop AI tools over time is also important, something Mercedes-Benz has achieved in starting small and being able to work up through different iterations of its forecasting system. Data governance is important and a company needs to be clear on who is responsible for that data and how it is shared to avoid costly and time-wasting duplication. Who it is shared with is also important and that needs to be democratic, involving those responsible for the direction of the business. ""If you can have a clear governance framework you make sure that your data is created once, cleaned once and then consumed by everyone.""

Data management is also crucial to supply chain mapping and JLR's director of supply chain digital and innovation, Simon Inskip, summarised his team's workshop in three main themes.

Data needs to be shared in a way that everyone is comfortable with and that again relies on a shared understanding, trust and a degree of impartiality. Inskip summed up the basic approach: ""When I ask you for a piece of data, do you know what I mean? Are you willing to share it? And if you do share it, do I trust that you've given me accurate data?"" He said Catena-X can hopefully provide the trust and impartiality needed.

With reliable data gathered it is also important to know what technology can make best use of it. ""In JLR alone we've mapped 180,000 points of our supply chain and if I want to do something meaningful with that, I need something more than a couple of spreadsheets,"" he said. Looking at different technologies for the retrieval and application of gathered data is important, according to Inskip's workshop group.

The impact of the technology on businesses depends on alignment on goals, methods and standards, and that required actually doing some meaningful with the sharing of data on a specific but large enough scale so that the learning from it can be shared for everyone's benefit, according to Inskip. From there it can refined and scaled.

Infineon's director of supply chain management, Soroush Nakhaie, led a workshop on how digital tools could help drive sustainability in the supply chain but found that data security was actually holding that back. Decarbonising the supply chain requires cooperation but sharing data on carbon expenditure remains a big hurdle. Sustainability is being driven by regulation, which affects the obligation to disclose information. ""Is it just an annual report on CO2 or is it really the obligation that the whole value chain exchanges information with each other and we know what CO2 a product from cradle to grave is actually creating?"" questioned Nakhaie.

Nakhaie also pointed to the insight that can be gained and implemented from the workforce and how important simple measures such as cutting large megabyte email attachments can actually mean for reducing electricity expenditure and cutting CO2.

Finally, Dr Tobias Engel, professor of supply chain management at the University of Applied Sciences, led a workshop on the value of digital twin technology in the supply chain. He said that digital twin technology is part of the industrial metaverse and its functionality was in being able to plan the supply chain based on what can be simulated and then control and monitor the processes during operations.

Digital twins enable collaboration regardless of physical space and like a multiplayer game it is possible for an OEM to bring a supplier or logistics provider into the same digital space to look at a particular problem. Engel took the example of transport disruption. ""You can see [together] if this is a ship or an airplane, and what is going on, is it a hurricane, is it a tornado? If it is a traffic jam, have you lost a container? This is the capability of digital twins and the industrial metaverse - you're able to manage the real world,"" he said.

Good master data and central storage are important for a company, as is having control of one's own data. Engel said that with a digital twin of the supply chain a company can secure material supply, foresee any environmental issues, measure transport emissions and see exactly where a product is in the supply chain, all guaranteeing better customer service. ""There are a lot of options with the digital twin and we're only at the beginning of the journey,"" said Engel.

3 December

After a couple of insightful presentations and panel sessions, we will be breaking onto our second coffee break for further networking and an exhibition hub visit where suppliers have set up stalls for delegates to experience! We will be back with a set of workshops on AI in supply chain and logistics, Tier-N supply chain, digitalisation in sustainability goals and digital supply chain twins with Mercedes-Benz AG, JLR, Autoliv, Infineon Technologies, University of Applied Sciences and University of Applied Sciences Neu-Ulm.

We will end the conference with a networking drinks reception with fellow attendees as we look forward to day two.

Following close on the heels of today's AI discussion, Frank Göller, took to the stage to outline the progress of the Catena-X data-sharing platform. Göller is head of strategy and portfolio management, digitalisation production/logistics at Audi. He is also vice-president of internationalisation at Catena-X and there has been significant progress in internationalisation since the data platform was established in Germany in 2021.

Companies in Europe, the US, China and Japan now have an understanding of what Catena-X can do to make manufacturing logistics processes more efficient and resilient through shared global standards for cross-border data exchange. That is no small feat and Göller admitted it is ""a complex beast to understand"" but making it a reality that lives as an organisation of data across the supply chain is even more tricky. The secret to a more efficient automotive supply chain relies on more small-to-medium-sized companies directly participating in it. Catena-X currently has 192 participating companies and over 6,000 community members worldwide but it has a target of getting 1,000 companies directly involved in data exchange by the end of next year.

That is important when considering how important supply chain transparency is in quicky identifying potential disruption to inbound parts and material flow, which Catena-X is designed to do. ""We all know the semiconductor crisis, and we all know the hiccups with missing parts in the supply chain flow to production,"" said Göller. ""Catena-X is addressing this.""

However, shared data is also important for addressing future regulatory requirements, such as product carbon footprint tracking, battery passports, circular economy regulations and textiles. ""It's not only automotive... if you're producing products you should think about how to fulfil the requirements of a product passport,"" said Göller, adding that Catena-X was a 'snowplough' clearing the road ahead for other industries. ""We have made an analysis that up to one billion data points have to be collected and reported in the year 2030 to fulfil forthcoming regulatory requirements.""

Göller said that Catena-X was set up to make the supply chain more efficient and effective by driving faster feedback loops between OEMs and suppliers to the tier-n level and smoothing the delivery of products to assembly. ""We know that if we can react quicker, we can solve problems and be much faster in the throughput time,"" he said. That relies on collaboration on the exchange of data and an open sharing of relevant capacity and demand data to improve the lean flow of parts.

Catana-X is not simply a data lake or a cloud, according to Göller, it is a data space that is based on collaboration, trusted services and interaction between the partners from across the supply chain; and it promises to cut costs. Those can be manufacturing and logistic savings by avoiding stoppages or hiccups in ramp up curves. It can herald cost saving by fulfilling regulatory requirements and avoiding fines for not doing so. And it can bring savings accrued through joint services, such as those related to master services with suppliers and using the golden record everyone wants to have.

""We can exchange data and there is no kind of hierarchy,"" said Göller. ""We are dancing together and choosing the music together.""

Alex Rotenberg, vice-president, industry practices at Kinaxis joins a panel discussion with Seat's Lerma and Díaz, and BMW's Richter, to discuss the role of control towers and human-AI collaboration.

The discussion is exploring the evolution of control towers, which serve as centralised platforms for managing supply chain data and workflows. Rotenberg describes a journey from ""self-healing"" supply chains that clean up data to ""self-learning"" systems that predict and resolve disruptions autonomously.

Seat's control tower strategy aligns closely with this model, incorporating generative AI to simulate scenarios and enable real-time decision-making across a growing network of suppliers and plants.

While the panel celebrates AI's transformative power, they also understand its limitations. Richter cautions that autonomous robots, factories and vehicles are not yet fully realised, and organisational challenges remain a significant barrier to broader adoption.

The consensus is clear: AI is a tool to empower, not replace, human intelligence. ""AI creates new jobs that focus on maintaining, training, and optimising these technologies, enabling us to combine human expertise with machine efficiency,"" Richter says.

3 December

Alexandre Lerma, manager of logistics, customer driven supply chain, Seat and Jorge Miguel Corral Díaz, senior IT specialist, AI, data & hyperautomation, Seat have taken to the stage to discuss the role AI-powered automation plays at the OEM, integrating data-driven decision-making and generative AI into operational processes.

Seat's digitalisation journey began with the creation of a unified data lake, using Snowflake on Azure, to consolidate siloed data across departments. This has enabled the company to enhance collaboration through federated working models, combining IT expertise with departmental data stewardship. Their low-code and no-code solutions, built on platforms such as Power BI and Vortex AI, empower employees to create efficient workflows and address logistical challenges.

Vortex AI, Seat's proprietary generative AI tool, offers various tailored solutions. Unlike off-the-shelf tools, Vortex AI ensures data privacy and compliance with European regulations like the AI and Data Acts, according to Lerma and Díaz.

The strategy is underpinned by robust employee training, with learning paths designed to upskill staff in tools, data stewardship, and low-code development.

BMW's head of next generation robotics, Carolin Richter, presents the company's cutting-edge advancements in AI-powered automation and robotics. Central to her keynote is BMW's collaboration with Figure AI, a robotics company advancing humanoid applications for industrial use.

Richter highlights BMW's ambition to develop ""intelligent robots"" capable of performing manual tasks previously deemed too complex or costly to automate. She underscores the potential for humanoid robots to revolutionise labour-intensive processes, addressing workforce shortages in BMW's production network.

The collaboration with Figure AI has already yielded significant milestones. Robots trained in Figure's San Francisco lab are tackling tasks like metal part insertion at BMW's Spartanburg plant. Initial trials showcased robots using AI to autonomously identify, manipulate and integrate components into production lines, offering flexibility and scalability.

Richter reveals plans to deploy these humanoids in active production settings by early 2025, overcoming challenges in safety, IT integration, and European AI regulatory compliance.

While logistics applications are still in early development, the potential to automate complex material handling and last-mile operations could bridge critical gaps in supply chain efficiency.

Now, we are joined by a panel discussing digital supply chain leaders and how a diversity of skills and talent can help accelerate a digital, more competitive future in Europe.

The panel (Juliana Raidt, head of data privacy and information security at Bosch; Harry Kwakye Davies, a senior global supply manager in the automotive industry; Trre Wong, senior manager, global supply chain digitalisation at Kautex Textron; and Saba Azizi, overseas service network & development manager at CATL) are sharing their personal journeys and actionable strategies to foster inclusion and equity in the automotive sector.

Retention strategies remain a focus for the panel. Davies says there needs to be a shift from mentorship to sponsorship, ensuring employees from underrepresented groups have the resources and visibility needed to thrive.

CATL's Azizi says the power of visible diversity in leadership in important. ""Young people lose motivation if they don't see representation at the top,"" she says, urging companies to focus on creating leadership pipelines for diverse talent.

Managing global teams with varying cultural norms poses challenges. Bosch's Raidt highlights the importance of communication: ""Leaders must create safe spaces where every team member feels valued and heard, regardless of background or seniority.""

Wong adds that digitial strategies can be used to improve diversity, saying that inclusivity extends to respecting different working styles and integrating digital tools to bridge gaps in digital literacy.

Paulina Chmielarz, digital and innovation director of Industrial Operations at JLR will be taking to the stage at ALSC Digital Strategies Europe next week to discuss how the carmaker's ongoing transformation will enhance transparency and integrated planning, including creating master datasets that ensure supply chain and logistics stakeholders can interact with and influence key processes, including engineering, materials and vehicle launch.

She took to the Red Sofa at last year's event to discuss ensuring the OEM's teams are fully aligned with the same data sets.

Frank Göller, head of digital strategy and portfolio management for production and logistics at Audi, and head of internationalisation at Catena-X, will be taking to the stage next week in Munich to discuss the future of data standards across boundaries and ensuring carmakers and suppliers can fully digitise their value chains.

Göller spoke to Automotive Logistics recently about how developing global standards for cross-border data exchange will make manufacturing logistics processes more efficient and resilient. He said that some companies are hesitant to share data, but that regulatory requirements coming into effect over the next three to five years could help ease concerns.

""Our analysis shows that over one billion data points have to be tracked, recorded and monitored for regulatory requirements up to the year 2030,"" he said. ""We have checked the different regulations in US, in China, in Japan - all around the world - and that means a really high amount of data tracking requirements by law.""

supply chain risk,Protection against cyber attacks: Strong network security with the SDoT Secure Network Card,firmenpresse.de,https://www.firmenpresse.de/pressrelease714845/protection-against-cyber-attacks-strong-network-security-with-the-sdot-secure-network-card.html,"(PresseBox) - infodas, an Airbus subsidiary specializing in cyber and IT, is unveiling its latest product, the SDoT Secure Network Card. Alongside a high level of integrity, the network card offers effective protection against supply chain attacks. The SDoT Secure Network Card can be used, by way of example, by operators of critical infrastructures, payment processors, as well as public authorities and the military. In the cloud and infrastructure sector, too, the cybersecurity tool offers the very highest levels of secure protection for in-house IT infrastructure. The hardware is approved up to the NATO SECRET classification level.

Featuring the latest generation of network security, the product reduces the risks to the integrity of host systems to a minimum. The public sector, the German armed forces, the defense industry and critical infrastructures are increasingly becoming a target for threat actors. This is precisely where the SDoT Secure Network Card comes into play. The transparent range of features successfully fends off attacks on the supply chain. The risk of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is also reduced significantly. This attack method involves saboteurs with in-depth technical expertise targeting a system over a prolonged period. Advantage of the infodas solution: sensitive data is processed in hardware. This means that companies and users retain full access to their business-critical data. The cybersecurity solution effectively prevents unauthorized access to management functions from the network.

'The SDoT Secure Network Card is the perfect addition to our certified SDoT product family. The tamper-proof network card exchanges information securely between the hardware and the operating system. Scrambling the data traffic protects the transmitted data and components of the host systems from unauthorized access. The SDoT Secure Network Card is therefore the only product to date that fulfills the VS requirements profile 'Secure Network Card' of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)', explains Dr. Malte Rast, Principal Product Certification at infodas.

The network card is manufactured and designed in Germany based on security-by-design principles. This approach means that infodas takes the security requirements for software and hardware into account as early on as during the product development stage in order to rule out vulnerabilities later on down the line. Real-time communication prevents transmission delays so that systems are permanently accessible. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has approved the product with BSI-VSA-10331. The SDoT Secure Network Card is approved for classification levels DEU SECRET, EU SECRET and NATO SECRET.

A detailed product profile and further information can be found here: https://www.infodas.com/en/solutions/sdot-secure-network-card/

INFODAS GmbH was founded in 1974 and is one of the leading providers for cyber and information security solutions in Germany. Since 2024, infodas has been an Airbus subsidiary specialized in Cyber & IT. It advises companies, authorities and the military by providing services aimed at designing and implementing comprehensive approaches to cyber and information security, as well as protecting IT infrastructures. The company also develops high-security products for cross domain solutions and the protection of critical infrastructures. infodas' SDoT product range is partly approved for classification levels DEU SECRET, EU SECRET and NATO SECRET.

supply chain risk,Electric car makers blasted in battery material mining report,Autocar,https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/electric-cars/electric-car-makers-blasted-battery-material-mining-report,"Demand for EV battery minerals is expected to increase ninefold between now and 2050

The world's largest electric car manufacturers are neglecting human rights by not addressing supply chain risk, according to Amnesty International.

The not-for-profit organisation's findings, published as part of a 102-page report, say a failure by car makers to tackle risk in their mineral supply chains has potentially left communities living closest to mines, where cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper are extracted, ""exposed to exploitation, health risks and environment harm"".

As part of the study, Amnesty International evaluated the human rights due diligence policies of 13 EV makers. It issued each one with a scorecard, which ranked them on their ""human rights policies, risk identification process, supply chain mapping and reporting and mediation"", marking them on a scale from one (worst) to 90 (best).

Amnesty International secretary general Agnès Callamard called the scores ""a massive disappointment"" and added that BYD's disclosures ""show a serious lack of transparency on human rights diligence in its battery supply chains"". She noted that Hyundai and Mitsubishi ""lack the necessary depth and information about implementation across key human rights due diligence areas"".

While Amnesty International gave each car maker the opportunity to reply and published their responses in full in the report, to ensure balance Autocar also contacted the manufacturers involved.

In a statement, Hyundai said it ""acknowledged receipt of Amnesty International's assessment"" and ""is committed to a sustainable, ethical supply chain that upholds human rights, environmental protection, and safety"".",,,,N/A,N/A,Unknown

(NYSE: LICY) (""Li-Cycle"" or the ""Company""), a leading global lithium-ion battery resource recovery company, is pleased to announce that the Company and Glencore International AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (LON: GLEN) (together with its subsidiaries, ""Glencore""), a leading producer, recycler and marketer of nickel and cobalt for the production of lithium-ion batteries, are resuming their collaboration to assess the technical and economic viability of developing a new Hub facility in Portovesme, Italy, including a concept and pre-feasibility study.

The study is expected to be led and funded by Glencore, with Li-Cycle providing technical expertise and support. The project would utilize infrastructure and equipment at Glencore's existing Portovesme metallurgical complex in Sardinia, Italy and leverage Li-Cycle's patented Spoke & Hub Technologies™ to produce critical battery materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt from recycled battery content. The black mass processed at the Portovesme Hub would be supplied from Glencore's commercial network and Li-Cycle's Spoke recycling facility located near Magdeburg, Germany.

Once operational, the Portovesme Hub would be expected to support the European battery supply chain by providing sustainable post-processing recycling capacity. The Company believes that the project would also support meeting EU minimum recycled content requirements for new batteries and the EU recycling target of at least 15% of strategic raw materials by 20301.

""We are pleased to continue our assessment and study of the Portovesme Hub project with Glencore,"" said Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle's President and CEO. ""We believe the project has significant potential and can address the lack of post-processing recycling capacity in Europe needed for a localized closed-loop battery supply chain and provide a sustainable secondary source of critical battery materials. Separately, we remain focused on securing a full funding package needed to restart construction at our flagship Rochester Hub project and enable the first advance under the finalized DOE loan facility.""

Following the recently announced $475-million loan facility with the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE Loan Facility""),2 a major milestone in the Company's funding efforts for the Rochester Hub project, Li-Cycle remains focused on securing the complete funding package required to restart the Rochester Hub project's construction and satisfy funding conditions for the first advance under the DOE Loan Facility. Li-Cycle is also continuing efforts to strengthen its Spoke business through optimization initiatives and improvements at its core Generation 3 Spoke recycling facilities.

The closing of the DOE Loan Facility triggers an automatic modification of the first tranche of the unsecured convertible notes issued by the Company to Glencore on May 31, 2022, as amended and restated on March 25, 2024 (the ""First A&R Glencore Convertible Note""). The modification, effective December 9, 2024, will result in adjustments to the maturity date, interest rate, and conversion price of the First A&R Glencore Convertible Note, as well as introduce mandatory redemption provisions and security interests, as described in the Company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The adjustment to the conversion price of the First A&R Glencore Convertible Note is expected to increase Glencore's beneficial ownership in the Company on a pro forma, fully-diluted basis to approximately 66% as of December 9, 2024. Definitive information regarding the modification will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed after the completion of the modification.

Li-Cycle continues to prioritize securing a complete funding package to restart construction of the Rochester Hub project and enable first advance of the DOE loan facility

Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LICY) (""Li-Cycle"" or the ""Company""), a leading global lithium-ion battery resource recovery company, is pleased to announce that the Company and Glencore International AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (LON: GLEN) (together with its subsidiaries, ""Glencore""), a leading producer, recycler and marketer of nickel and cobalt for the production of lithium-ion batteries, are resuming their collaboration to assess the technical and economic viability of developing a new Hub facility in Portovesme, Italy, including a concept and pre-feasibility study.

The study is expected to be led and funded by Glencore, with Li-Cycle providing technical expertise and support. The project would utilize infrastructure and equipment at Glencore's existing Portovesme metallurgical complex in Sardinia, Italy and leverage Li-Cycle's patented Spoke Hub Technologies to produce critical battery materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt from recycled battery content. The black mass processed at the Portovesme Hub would be supplied from Glencore's commercial network and Li-Cycle's Spoke recycling facility located near Magdeburg, Germany.

Once operational, the Portovesme Hub would be expected to support the European battery supply chain by providing sustainable post-processing recycling capacity. The Company believes that the project would also support meeting EU minimum recycled content requirements for new batteries and the EU recycling target of at least 15% of strategic raw materials by 20301

""We are pleased to continue our assessment and study of the Portovesme Hub project with Glencore,"" said Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle's President and CEO. ""We believe the project has significant potential and can address the lack of post-processing recycling capacity in Europe needed for a localized closed-loop battery supply chain and provide a sustainable secondary source of critical battery materials. Separately, we remain focused on securing a full funding package needed to restart construction at our flagship Rochester Hub project and enable the first advance under the finalized DOE loan facility.""

Following the recently announced $475-million loan facility with the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE Loan Facility""),2 a major milestone in the Company's funding efforts for the Rochester Hub project, Li-Cycle remains focused on securing the complete funding package required to restart the Rochester Hub project's construction and satisfy funding conditions for the first advance under the DOE Loan Facility. Li-Cycle is also continuing efforts to strengthen its Spoke business through optimization initiatives and improvements at its core Generation 3 Spoke recycling facilities.

The closing of the DOE Loan Facility triggers an automatic modification of the first tranche of the unsecured convertible notes issued by the Company to Glencore on May 31, 2022, as amended and restated on March 25, 2024 (the ""First A&R Glencore Convertible Note""). The modification, effective December 9, 2024, will result in adjustments to the maturity date, interest rate, and conversion price of the First A&R Glencore Convertible Note, as well as introduce mandatory redemption provisions and security interests, as described in the Company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The adjustment to the conversion price of the First A&R Glencore Convertible Note is expected to increase Glencore's beneficial ownership in the Company on a pro forma, fully-diluted basis to approximately 66% as of December 9, 2024. Definitive information regarding the modification will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed after the completion of the modification.

supply chain risk,Vauxhall plant closure could cost Luton £150m per year - but consultation continues despite CEO's resignation,Luton Today,https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/business/closure-of-vauxhall-plant-major-threat-that-could-cost-luton-economy-ps150m-per-year-but-consultation-continues-despite-ceos-resignation-4896235,"Rachel Hopkins MP for Luton South has urgently called on the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds, to meet with workers and trade union representatives - and he has accepted the invitation.

There have also been calls to halt the consultation and proposed plant closure amid the resignation of Carlos Tavares, Group CEO at parent company Stellantis.

However, Stellantis has confirmed that there will be ""no changes to the proposals"" despite his departure, and that it is ""engaged with all interested parties"" during the ongoing consultation period.

In a letter to the Secretary of State, Ms Hopkins stated: ""The situation requires urgent action.

""1,600 jobs and thousands in the wider supply chain are at risk a month before Christmas. It's these workers who have gone above and beyond to drive efficiencies and cut costs to improve Stellantis's profit margins.

""They are repaid with fast plant closure by Q2 2025 and an offer of relocation to the Ellesmere Port site, which may simply be impractical for many workers and their families.""

Ms Hopkins confirmed that the Secretary of State had promised to ""deploy his department to provide whatever help is required"".

Meanwhile, Ms Hopkins has requested that the government pursues ""every avenue available"" to protect the plant.

Her letter continued: ""The announcement is a major threat to our town's future growth. If the plant is closed, I have been informed by Luton Council that up to £150m could be lost from the local economy per annum and potentially £160m from further supply chain impacts.""

In response to the resignation of Taveres, Save Our Town claimed on social media: ""A Stellantis statement has said that a replacement is expected by the middle of 2025. In these circumstances it is inconceivable that Stellantis continue with the closure. We call for the immediate postponement of the Luton plant plans.""

A spokesman for Stellantis, said: ""There are no changes to the proposals made despite the resignation of the CEO. For the other questions, these remain as proposals from the company and we are actively engaged with all interested parties in this consulation period.""

Councillor Hazel Simmons MBE, Leader of Luton Council, said: ""The news that Vauxhall plans to close its van making factory in Luton is a devastating blow for our town.

""First and foremost, our thoughts are with the employees and their families who have received this deeply distressing news.

""The impact of this proposal on our town should not be underestimated, with a potential loss of 1,200 jobs at the plant and a further 2,500 from the wider supply chain, and an estimated blow to the local economy of £310m.

""We won't let this happen without a fight and on hearing about the plans we immediately arranged meetings with the plant's management, trade unions and MPs to explore what can be done to save the plant and the jobs.

""Vauxhall has been an integral part of Luton's heritage for decades and we will do all we can to stop this closure going ahead.""",,,,N/A,N/A,Luton
supply chain risk,Italian fashion brand TWINSET partners with TrusTrace to support supply chain traceability and environmental impact initiatives,American Journal of Transportation magazine,https://www.ajot.com/news/italian-fashion-brand-twinset-partners-with-trustrace-to-support-supply-chain-traceability-and-environmental-impact-initiatives,"TrusTrace, a global SaaS company with a market-leading platform for product traceability and supply chain compliance in fashion and retail, today announced that TWINSET, a high-end Italian fashion brand, has selected the TrusTrace platform to help identify suppliers, support eco-design initiatives, and measure each product's environmental impact.

""By partnering with TrusTrace, TWINSET has deepened its commitment to tracing their supply chain in granular detail. Now, they can better understand where and how their clothing is produced, and track each product's environmental impact - all within one platform,"" said TrusTrace CEO and Co-Founder Shameek Ghosh.

According to Silvia Zaganelli, Traceability and Business Development Manager at TWINSET, ""Since signing on with TrusTrace in May 2024, we have started implementing the TrusTrace platform as the backbone of our three-year Traceability program. This is a company-wide strategic program ambitioning to discover sub-suppliers, map and collect data for key value processes, and achieve PO-level traceability.""

With a three-year roadmap, results will be reached progressively by scaling-up to ultimately trace the full range of product categories and suppliers. Key objectives are to identify material country of origin, manage supply-chain risk such as forced labour, and enable eco-design by assessing the environmental impact of the product. To support the environmental impact initiative, TrusTrace partnered with a leading life cycle assessment (LCA) solution Peftrust, which feeds traceability data directly to the LCA solution to get the most precise PEF (Product Environmental Footprint) scoring.

This strategic initiative has especially helped support TWINSET to prepare for incoming regulations such as Digital Product Passports (DPPs) which will be mandatory on textiles sold in Europe by 2030, as well as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires companies to report on their environmental and social impact.",,,,N/A,N/A,PO
supply chain risk,Ensuring Stability: UK's New Framework for Critical Third Party Providers,Bird & Bird,https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/uk/ensuring-stability-uks-new-framework-for-critical-third-party-providers,"Joint publication confirming UK regime for designated critical third party providers to the financial services sector in the UK

On 12 November 2024, a joint supervisory statement by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Bank of England (BoE) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was issued, creating a new regulatory framework to manage risks to the stability of the UK financial system which could arise due to failure or disruption to the services that a critical third party (CTP) provides to firms in the financial sector, Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector (Statutory statement 6/24).

On international interoperability the statutory statement provides that the ""UK oversight regime for CTPs is designed to be interoperable with similar non-UK regimes, such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) in the European Union...but only to the extent that such interoperability does not conflict with or undermine the Overall Objective"".

The regime only applies when a prospective CTP has been assessed by HM Treasury (HMT) as providing services for which failure in, or disruption to, the provision of these services could threaten the stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial system.

The new rules primarily affect CTPs and potential CTPs. The policy does not apply to any one type of service, the new regime is intended to be technology-neutral and focuses on regulatory outcomes.

Requirements are focused on CTPs providing services to firms and financial market infrastructure operators (FMIs) and do not directly impose regulatory obligations on financial services firms.

HMT expects that CTPs will represent only a small number of overall third parties to the financial sector.

The regulators will not recommend for designation as a CTP the following financial firms:

However the new rules may also be of interest to financial service firms and financial market infrastructure firms as there are likely to be operational resilience issues to consider in relation to their arrangements with such CTPs. Separately, the FCA has published its own guidance on the lessons for financial services firm to learn from the Crowdstrike outage and the operational issues to identify and address from an operational resilience perspective.

HMT expects to designate a CTP based on recommendations from the financial regulators, however it is also possible for HMT to designate a CTP without recommendations.

The statutory statement provides the following definitions:

(i) persons authorised by the PRA and/or the FCA (both on a dual-regulated and FCA-solo regulated basis, including UK authorised branches of non-UK firms);

(ii) financial market infrastructure entities (FMI), as defined in s312L(8) of FSMA, including:

(iii) relevant service providers, as defined in s312L(8) of FSMA, including:

The framework includes CTP Fundamental Rules that a CTP is required to comply with in respect to all services it provides to financial services firms, they provide a general statement of a CTP's fundamental obligations under the oversight regime and applies to all services provided by the CTP to firms and FMIs, not only material services.

The rules consist of six CTP Fundamental Rules, with respect to the services provided. Rules 1-5 are substantive obligations with regard a CTP's provision of 'systemic third-party services', whereas rule 6 will apply in relation to all other services that a CTP may provide to a firm.

CTP Fundamental Rule 1: A CTP must conduct its business with integrity.

CTP Fundamental Rule 2: A CTP must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence.

CTP Fundamental Rule 3: A CTP must act in a prudent manner.

CTP Fundamental Rule 4: A CTP must have effective risk strategies and risk management systems.

CTP Fundamental Rule 5: A CTP must organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively.

CTP Fundamental Rule 6: A CTP must deal with the regulators in an open and co-operative way, and disclose to the regulators appropriately anything relating to the CTP of which they would reasonably expect notice.

The framework recognises that CTPs may perform different functions and have different makeups. The framework has been designed to be outcomes focused and recognises there are several ways requirements may be met.

The statutory statement provides that the operational risk and resilience requirements only apply in the relation to the provision of a CTP's systemic third-party services to firms. A CTP is expected to continuously improve the resilience of their systematic third party services as learns from incidents, exercises and testing.

Requirement 1: Governance: a CTP must ensure that its governance arrangements promote the resilience of any systemic third party service it provides.

Requirement 2: Risk management: a CTP must manage effectively risks to its ability to deliver a systemic third party service.

Requirement 3: Dependency and supply chain risk management: a CTP must (as part of its obligation under Requirement 2) identify and manage any risks to its supply chain that could affect its ability to deliver a systemic third party service. A CTP must take reasonable steps to ensure that its Key Nth party providers and persons connected with a CTP that are part of its supply chain.

Requirement 4: Technology and cyber resilience: a CTP must (as part of its obligation under Requirement 2) take reasonable steps to ensure the resilience of any technology that delivers, maintains or supports a systemic third party service.

Requirement 5: Change management: a CTP must ensure that it has a systematic and effective approach to dealing with changes to a systemic third party service, including changes to the processes or technologies used to deliver, maintain or support a systemic third party service.

Requirement 6: Mapping: to include resources, assets, supporting services and technology, any internal, external interconnections and interdependencies between resources.

Requirement 7: Incident management: a CTP must effectively manage CTP operational incidents.

A CTP is also required to carry out regular scenario testing and incident management playbook exercises to ensure it can continue providing a systemic third-party service(s) an appropriate maximum tolerable level of disruption in the event of a severe but plausible disruption to its operations. If a CTP does not already have an appropriate scenario-testing programme at the point of designation, it should implement a programme and carry out its first scenario tests no later than 12 months following designation by HM Treasury

Requirement 8: Termination of services: a CTP must have in place appropriate measures to respond to a termination of any of its systemic third party services (for any reason).

A CTP is required to demonstrate its ability to comply with the rules and provide what is referred as 'general evidence requirement' including regular self assessments, scenario testing and incident management playbook exercises and providing regulatory information on request. Self-assessments are required within three months of designation and annually after.

The regulators have the ability to order skilled persons reviews of CTPs and carry out investigations (s312P of FSMA) ('information-gathering and investigatory powers'); and take enforcement action against a CTP (s312Q and s312R of FSMA) ('disciplinary powers').

FSMA 2023 gives the Bank of England (BoE), Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), collectively, the financial regulators, the power to enforce the rules, gather information and conduct investigations on CTPs.

The CTP regime does not mandate establishing a UK entity and instead applies to firms regardless of where they are provided from. The CTP can appoint a central point of contact for the regulators and provide the regulators with a UK address for service for documents including statutory notices.

For CTPs with a head office outside of the UK, regulators have proposed that a CTP with no presence or employees in the UK should appoint a law firm or other suitable UK-based corporate body, partnership, or limited liability partnership as its representative.

Once a recommendation is made the Treasury will write to the CTP to open a period of formal representations and will advise the CTP of the expected timeframe.

HMT estimates that every recommendation will take about 6 months to process .

The final rules for CTPs will take effect from 1 January 2025.

Once designated a CTP obligations will start for a CTP from a date specified by HMT to in the designation order, certain requirements will be subject to applicable transition periods.",,,,N/A,N/A,UK
supply chain risk,China's API Dominance Reshapes Global Pharmaceutical Supply Chains,chemanalyst.com,https://www.chemanalyst.com/NewsAndDeals/NewsDetails/china-api-dominance-reshapes-global-pharmaceutical-supply-chains-31893,"In a significant shift in global pharmaceutical manufacturing dynamics, China's dominance in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) production continues to strengthen, even as manufacturing activities show divergent trends across major economies. Recent data reveals a complex landscape where China's manufacturing expansion contrasts sharply with European contraction, raising concerns about pharmaceutical supply chain resilience.

Global Manufacturing Divergence

Manufacturing activity in Europe has hit a concerning low, with the HCOB's euro zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropping to 45.2 in November, marking an extended period of contraction since mid-2022. Germany, Europe's largest economy, remains particularly affected, while France experiences its steepest decline in new orders since the early COVID-19 pandemic.

In contrast, Chinese factories have shown remarkable resilience, with manufacturing activity expanding at its fastest pace in five months. The Caixin PMI data indicates robust growth in new orders, including international demand, suggesting that Beijing's stimulus measures are beginning to yield results.

China's Strategic Position in API Production

China's stronghold on API manufacturing has become increasingly significant for several key reasons:

1. Production Capacity: China commands the global API market, with overwhelming market share in critical therapeutic categories: analgesics (Ibuprofen: 90-95% of US/EU imports), antipyretics (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: ~70% global supply), antibiotics (Doxycycline), antimicrobials (Azithromycin), and antidiabetics (Metformin) having>80% import dependency, among numerous other essential pharmaceutical raw materials.

2. Cost Advantages: Lower production costs and government support enable Chinese manufacturers to price APIs 35-40% below Western competitors, while maintaining FDA/EMA quality standards.

3. Supply Chain: China's well-established supply chain networks serve over 180 countries, with robust partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies in the US and Europe, ensuring reliable distribution of critical APIs worldwide.

Impact on Western Markets

The US and European pharmaceutical sectors face growing dependency on Chinese API imports, creating potential vulnerabilities:

* Supply Chain Risk: Over-reliance on a single geographic source for critical pharmaceutical ingredients raises concerns about supply chain resilience.

* Pricing Dynamics: Chinese API pricing significantly influences global pharmaceutical commodity markets.

* Manufacturing Competitiveness: Western manufacturers struggle to maintain cost-competitive domestic API production.

Future Outlook and Policy Implications

As geopolitical tensions rise and trade policies evolve, several factors could reshape the API manufacturing landscape:

1. Trade Policies: Proposed tariffs by returning US President Trump could significantly impact supply chains and pricing including that of pharmaceuticals.

2. Reshoring Initiatives: Both US and European authorities are exploring policies to incentivize domestic API production. However, the question arises - How?

Regional Manufacturing Trends

Recent overall manufacturing data shows varying patterns across regions:

* Europe: Continued contraction with PMI at 45.2

* United States: Modest improvement with ISM index at 48.4

* China: Expansion driven by stimulus and export rush

The global pharmaceutical industry stands at a crossroads, with China's API manufacturing dominance highlighting broader questions about supply chain security and manufacturing sovereignty. As Western economies grapple with manufacturing slowdowns and increased import dependency, the need for strategic planning and potential policy interventions becomes increasingly apparent.

The coming months will be crucial in determining whether current trends persist or if new policies and market forces will begin to reshape the global pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape. According to ChemAnalyst, the industry must carefully balance cost considerations against supply chain resilience while navigating an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Beijing, US, United States, Germany, China, France"

States can opt in to an outcomes-based agreement with bluebird through the Model until February 28, 2025

SOMERVILLE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLUE) (bluebird bio) today announced it has reached an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to offer an outcomes-based agreement for LYFGENIA gene therapy under the Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model. LYFGENIA is a one-time gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs).

Ensuring timely, equitable access to gene therapy for people living with sickle cell disease insured through Medicaid has been a cornerstone of our commercial approach since approval, and we are pleased to build on this commitment by offering an outcomes-based agreement to state Medicaid agencies through the Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model, said Tom Klima, Chief Commercial & Operating Officer at bluebird bio. We are also pleased to be able to offer fertility preservation support to eligible patients insured by Medicaid in states that opt into the Model, as we recognize these services address an important potential barrier to access.

Participation in the CGT Access Model builds on bluebird's established leadership in developing and implementing innovative outcomes-based agreements and has the potential to further strengthen the coverage landscape for LYFGENIA. To date, more than half of all states have affirmed coverage for LYFGENIA through Preferred Drug Lists or published coverage policies, and over 50% of Medicaid-insured individuals with sickle cell disease in the U.S. live in a state that has approved at least one prior authorization for LYFGENIA.

bluebird currently offers two outcomes-based agreements for LYFGENIA to State Medicaid Agencies, and the CGT Access Model may be a bandwidth extender for states that are unable to implement outcomes-based agreements on their own or in a timely fashion. bluebird's offering through the CGT Access Model is rooted in its validated principles of meaningful risk sharing for payers, and tying performance to clinically meaningful outcomes that are easily tracked through established data sources over a defined period of time.

The model will enroll patients for a period of 6 years and individual patients will be followed for 5 years to track performance-related outcomes. Participation in the CGT Access Model is voluntary and open to all states that participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). With key terms in place, states have until February 28, 2025 to opt-in to participate and states may begin participation in the Model between January 2025 and January 2026.

About LYFGENIA™ (lovotibeglogene autotemcel) or lovo-cel

LYFGENIA is a one-time ex-vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). LYFGENIA works by adding a functional Î²-globin gene to patients' own hematopoietic (blood) stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Durable production of adult hemoglobin with anti-sickling properties (HbAT87Q) is possible following successful engraftment. HbAT87Q has a similar oxygen-binding affinity to wild-type HbA, limits sickling of red blood cells and has the potential to reduce VOEs.

The Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of LYFGENIA is complete and the Phase 3 HGB-210 study evaluating LYFGENIA is ongoing. bluebird bio is also conducting a long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study (LTF-307) for patients with sickle cell disease who have been treated with LYFGENIA in bluebird bio-sponsored clinical studies.

Indication

LYFGENIA is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs).

Limitations of Use

Following treatment with LYFGENIA, patients with Î±-thalassemia trait (-Î±3.7/-Î±3.7) may experience anemia with erythroid dysplasia that may require chronic red blood cell transfusions. LYFGENIA has not been studied in patients with more than two Î±-globin gene deletions.

Hematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA. Monitor patients closely for evidence of malignancy through complete blood counts at least every 6 months and through integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted.

Hematologic Malignancy

Hematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA (Study 1, Group A). At the time of initial product approval, two patients treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A) developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One patient with Î±-thalassemia trait (Study 1, Group C) has been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The additional hematopoietic stress associated with mobilization, conditioning, and infusion of LYFGENIA, including the need to regenerate the hematopoietic system, may increase the risk of a hematologic malignancy. Patients with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of hematologic malignancy as compared to the general population.

Patients treated with LYFGENIA may develop hematologic malignancies and should have lifelong monitoring. Monitor for hematologic malignancies with a complete blood count (with differential) at least every 6 months for at least 15 years after treatment with LYFGENIA, and integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted.

In the event that a malignancy occurs, contact bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of samples for testing.

Post-Marketing Long Term Follow-Up Study: Patients who intend to receive treatment with LYFGENIA are encouraged to enroll in the study, as available, to assess the long-term safety of LYFGENIA and the risk of malignancies occurring after treatment with LYFGENIA by calling bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378. The study includes monitoring (at pre-specified intervals) for clonal expansion.

Delayed Platelet Engraftment

Delayed platelet engraftment has been observed with LYFGENIA. Bleeding risk is increased prior to platelet engraftment and may continue after engraftment in patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia. Two patients (4%) required more than 100 days post treatment with LYFGENIA to achieve platelet engraftment.

Patients should be made aware of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Monitor patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding according to standard guidelines. Conduct frequent platelet counts until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Perform blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise.

Neutrophil Engraftment Failure

There is a potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with LYFGENIA. Neutrophil engraftment failure is defined as failure to achieve three consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ‰¥ 0.5 Ã -- 109 cells/L obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of LYFGENIA. Monitor neutrophil counts until engraftment has been achieved. If neutrophil engraftment failure occurs in a patient treated with LYFGENIA, provide rescue treatment with the back-up collection of CD34+ cells.

Insertional Oncogenesis

There is a potential risk of lentiviral vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis after treatment with LYFGENIA.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of LYFGENIA. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40 in LYFGENIA may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Anti-retroviral Use

Patients should not take prophylactic HIV anti-retroviral medications for at least one month prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. There are some long-acting anti-retroviral medications that may require a longer duration of discontinuation for elimination of the medication. If a patient is taking anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, confirm a negative test for HIV before beginning mobilization and apheresis of CD34+ cells.

Hydroxyurea Use

Patients should not take hydroxyurea for at least 2 months prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. If hydroxyurea is administered between mobilization and conditioning, discontinue 2 days prior to initiation of conditioning.

Iron Chelation

Drug-drug interactions between iron chelators and the mobilization process and myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered. Iron chelators should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of mobilization or conditioning. Do not administer myelosuppressive iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone) for 6 months post-treatment with LYFGENIA. Non-myelosuppressive iron chelation should be restarted no sooner than 3 months after LYFGENIA infusion. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate.

Interference with PCR-based Testing

Patients who have received LYFGENIA are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to integrated BB305 LVV proviral DNA, resulting in a possible false-positive PCR assay test result for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received LYFGENIA should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions ‰¥ Grade 3 (incidence ‰¥ 20%) were stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia.

Three patients died during LYFGENIA clinical trials; one from sudden cardiac death due to underlying disease and two from acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A).

Pregnancy/Lactation

Advise patients of the risks associated with myeloablative conditioning agents, including on pregnancy and fertility.

LYFGENIA should not be administered to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

LYFGENIA is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding, and breastfeeding after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before LYFGENIA administration.

Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child should use an effective method of contraception (intra-uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of LYFGENIA.

Advise patients of the options for fertility preservation.

Iron chelators should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of mobilization or conditioning. Do not administer myelosuppressive iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone) for 6 months post-treatment with LYFGENIA. Non-myelosuppressive iron chelation should be restarted no sooner than 3 months after LYFGENIA infusion. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate.

Interference with PCR-based Testing

Patients who have received LYFGENIA are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to integrated BB305 LVV proviral DNA, resulting in a possible false-positive PCR assay test result for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received LYFGENIA should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions ‰¥ Grade 3 (incidence ‰¥ 20%) were stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia.

Three patients died during LYFGENIA clinical trials; one from sudden cardiac death due to underlying disease and two from acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A).

Pregnancy/Lactation

Advise patients of the risks associated with myeloablative conditioning agents, including on pregnancy and fertility.

LYFGENIA should not be administered to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

LYFGENIA is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding, and breastfeeding after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before LYFGENIA administration.

Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child should use an effective method of contraception (intra-uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of LYFGENIA.

Advise patients of the options for fertility preservation.

States can opt in to an outcomes-based agreement with bluebird through the Model until February 28, 2025

SOMERVILLE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLUE) (""bluebird bio"") today announced it has reached an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to offer an outcomes-based agreement for LYFGENIA gene therapy under the Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model. LYFGENIA is a one-time gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs).

""Ensuring timely, equitable access to gene therapy for people living with sickle cell disease insured through Medicaid has been a cornerstone of our commercial approach since approval, and we are pleased to build on this commitment by offering an outcomes-based agreement to state Medicaid agencies through the Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model,"" said Tom Klima, Chief Commercial & Operating Officer at bluebird bio. ""We are also pleased to be able to offer fertility preservation support to eligible patients insured by Medicaid in states that opt into the Model, as we recognize these services address an important potential barrier to access.""

Participation in the CGT Access Model builds on bluebird's established leadership in developing and implementing innovative outcomes-based agreements and has the potential to further strengthen the coverage landscape for LYFGENIA. To date, more than half of all states have affirmed coverage for LYFGENIA through Preferred Drug Lists or published coverage policies, and over 50% of Medicaid-insured individuals with sickle cell disease in the U.S. live in a state that has approved at least one prior authorization for LYFGENIA.

bluebird currently offers two outcomes-based agreements for LYFGENIA to State Medicaid Agencies, and the CGT Access Model may be a bandwidth extender for states that are unable to implement outcomes-based agreements on their own or in a timely fashion. bluebird's offering through the CGT Access Model is rooted in its validated principles of meaningful risk sharing for payers, and tying performance to clinically meaningful outcomes that are easily tracked through established data sources over a defined period of time.

The model will enroll patients for a period of 6 years and individual patients will be followed for 5 years to track performance-related outcomes. Participation in the CGT Access Model is voluntary and open to all states that participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). With key terms in place, states have until February 28, 2025 to opt-in to participate and states may begin participation in the Model between January 2025 and January 2026.

About LYFGENIA™ (lovotibeglogene autotemcel) or lovo-cel

LYFGENIA is a one-time ex-vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). LYFGENIA works by adding a functional β-globin gene to patients' own hematopoietic (blood) stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Durable production of adult hemoglobin with anti-sickling properties (HbAT87Q) is possible following successful engraftment. HbAT87Q has a similar oxygen-binding affinity to wild-type HbA, limits sickling of red blood cells and has the potential to reduce VOEs.

The Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of LYFGENIA is complete and the Phase 3 HGB-210 study evaluating LYFGENIA is ongoing. bluebird bio is also conducting a long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study (LTF-307) for patients with sickle cell disease who have been treated with LYFGENIA in bluebird bio-sponsored clinical studies.

Indication

LYFGENIA is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs).

Limitations of Use

Following treatment with LYFGENIA, patients with α-thalassemia trait (-α3.7/-α3.7) may experience anemia with erythroid dysplasia that may require chronic red blood cell transfusions. LYFGENIA has not been studied in patients with more than two α-globin gene deletions.

Hematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA. Monitor patients closely for evidence of malignancy through complete blood counts at least every 6 months and through integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted.

Hematologic Malignancy

Hematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA (Study 1, Group A). At the time of initial product approval, two patients treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A) developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One patient with α-thalassemia trait (Study 1, Group C) has been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The additional hematopoietic stress associated with mobilization, conditioning, and infusion of LYFGENIA, including the need to regenerate the hematopoietic system, may increase the risk of a hematologic malignancy. Patients with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of hematologic malignancy as compared to the general population.

Patients treated with LYFGENIA may develop hematologic malignancies and should have lifelong monitoring. Monitor for hematologic malignancies with a complete blood count (with differential) at least every 6 months for at least 15 years after treatment with LYFGENIA, and integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted.

In the event that a malignancy occurs, contact bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of samples for testing.

Post-Marketing Long Term Follow-Up Study: Patients who intend to receive treatment with LYFGENIA are encouraged to enroll in the study, as available, to assess the long-term safety of LYFGENIA and the risk of malignancies occurring after treatment with LYFGENIA by calling bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378. The study includes monitoring (at pre-specified intervals) for clonal expansion.

Delayed Platelet Engraftment

Delayed platelet engraftment has been observed with LYFGENIA. Bleeding risk is increased prior to platelet engraftment and may continue after engraftment in patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia. Two patients (4%) required more than 100 days post treatment with LYFGENIA to achieve platelet engraftment.

Patients should be made aware of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Monitor patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding according to standard guidelines. Conduct frequent platelet counts until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Perform blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise.

Neutrophil Engraftment Failure

There is a potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with LYFGENIA. Neutrophil engraftment failure is defined as failure to achieve three consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 0.5 × 109 cells/L obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of LYFGENIA. Monitor neutrophil counts until engraftment has been achieved. If neutrophil engraftment failure occurs in a patient treated with LYFGENIA, provide rescue treatment with the back-up collection of CD34+ cells.

Insertional Oncogenesis

There is a potential risk of lentiviral vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis after treatment with LYFGENIA.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of LYFGENIA. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40 in LYFGENIA may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Anti-retroviral Use

Patients should not take prophylactic HIV anti-retroviral medications for at least one month prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. There are some long-acting anti-retroviral medications that may require a longer duration of discontinuation for elimination of the medication. If a patient is taking anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, confirm a negative test for HIV before beginning mobilization and apheresis of CD34+ cells.

Hydroxyurea Use

Patients should not take hydroxyurea for at least 2 months prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. If hydroxyurea is administered between mobilization and conditioning, discontinue 2 days prior to initiation of conditioning.

Iron Chelation

Drug-drug interactions between iron chelators and the mobilization process and myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered. Iron chelators should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of mobilization or conditioning. Do not administer myelosuppressive iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone) for 6 months post-treatment with LYFGENIA. Non-myelosuppressive iron chelation should be restarted no sooner than 3 months after LYFGENIA infusion. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate.

Interference with PCR-based Testing

Patients who have received LYFGENIA are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to integrated BB305 LVV proviral DNA, resulting in a possible false-positive PCR assay test result for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received LYFGENIA should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 (incidence ≥ 20%) were stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia.

Three patients died during LYFGENIA clinical trials; one from sudden cardiac death due to underlying disease and two from acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A).

Pregnancy/Lactation

Advise patients of the risks associated with myeloablative conditioning agents, including on pregnancy and fertility.

LYFGENIA should not be administered to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

LYFGENIA is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding, and breastfeeding after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before LYFGENIA administration.

Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child should use an effective method of contraception (intra-uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of LYFGENIA.

supply chain risk,A digital supply chain approach,Evertiq,https://evertiq.com/design/56876,"At the Evertiq Expo in Gothenburg this September, I had the opportunity to sit down with Lukas Zimmermann, Sales Executive at Luminovo, to dive into the evolving landscape of digital supply chains and the role of Luminovo in transforming how electronic designers, manufacturers and suppliers manage their operations.

What is a digital supply chain, and why should we care?

Zimmermann explained, ""It's about putting all the different stakeholders -- every participant in the process -- at the same table. The aim is to ensure that all the information needed is equally visible, accessible, and understood by everyone.""

The simplicity of this explanation touches on the essence of Luminovo's solution, where clarity and accessibility across the supply chain drive efficiency and collaboration.

But the question remains -- why is there a need for this new approach when the existing systems have served the industry well enough to support its growth thus far: Why go digital?

Zimmermann broke it down into three key reasons:

Speed: Digital systems reduce manual tasks, streamline procurement processes, and accelerate overall operations. ""You're just much faster,"" Zimmermann noted, which translates into competitive advantages, particularly in winning new business deals.

Cost and time savings: Replacing manual processes like sorting through Excel files to identify the best deals saves time and reduces errors. By automating these tasks, companies can focus on higher-value activities.

Stronger partnerships: A digital system fosters collaboration, making it easier and quicker for stakeholders to work together, thus strengthening relationships across the supply chain.

Risk mitigation and visibility

When asked about risk mitigation -- such as being alerted when a supplier faces disruptions -- Zimmermann acknowledged that Luminovo's platform doesn't yet cover logistics-related incidents, such as a sudden production halt at a supplier. However, it excels in managing the complexity of sourcing and procurement in the electronics industry. ""Luminovo helps reduce the complexity of quoting, sourcing, and monitoring changes in the PCBA,"" he said, emphasising its ability to track and warn against availability, compliance, and lifecycle changes.

""We want to offer our customers a comprehensive workflow -- one complete solution where they have everything. What we often see is that many rely on Excel and a few other tools, but these tools often don't cover everything and don't communicate with each other enough. As a result, you are working with multiple tools that are not really well connected.""

Expanding globally while keeping an eye on Europe

Luminovo, which started in Germany, has grown significantly across Europe, and Zimmermann highlighted the company's presence in other regions like Asia and the U.S. Although these markets are still in their early stages for the company, Zimmermann acknowledged their importance.

""We have customers in Asia and the U.S., but not so many yet. Obviously, we want to increase that presence, especially with big EMS players in Thailand, Malaysia, and the U.S.""

However, expanding beyond Europe brings unique challenges, particularly due to cultural and business differences. Zimmermann pointed out that having people on-site in different regions will be essential as they scale.

Although Luminovo is expanding, Zimmermann revealed that there is still significant growth potential in their home market.

As Luminovo continues to evolve, Zimmermann hinted at upcoming developments: ""We're planning to release a new module in the next one to two months that will help with strategic negotiations, which will be interesting for all OEMs and EMS companies with significant electronics purchasing needs.""

With its focus on providing an integrated, seamless digital workflow, Luminovo is positioning itself as a key player in the digital transformation of the electronics manufacturing industry - setting the stage for a more efficient, collaborative, and resilient supply chain.",,,,N/A,N/A,"Malaysia, U.S., Thailand, Gothenburg, Zimmermann, Germany"

supply chain risk,CCLA's Dame Sara Thornton: Forced labour is 'a feature of the system' in the UK - PA Future,ESG Clarity,https://future.portfolio-adviser.com/cclas-dame-sara-thornton-forced-labour-is-a-feature-of-the-system-in-the-uk-2/,"Weak legislation has turned the UK into 'a dumping ground' for slavery-linked goods and services

Modern slavery exists in the supply chains of almost every business in the UK, making it nearly impossible for investors to avoid exposure to, according to CCLA.

The UK imports $26.1bn worth of goods a year which have a 'very high likelihood' of coming from slave labour, according to the Walk Free Foundation, and while many leading British brands would publicly deny this, the Ethical Trading Initiative found that 77% suspect modern slavery in their supply chains when asked anonymously.

Despite universal condemnation, modern slavery is rampant across every sector of the UK market - and most investors are oblivious to it, according to Dame Sara Thornton, consultant to CCLA's modern slavery programme and former Home Office anti-slavery commissioner.

""Forced labour isn't just a bug in the system, it's a feature of the system. This is so endemic and that's why it needs to be addressed,"" she said.

And the UK's copious links to modern slavery aren't purely from overseas cases. There are an estimated 122,000 people in modern slavery in the UK according to the British Safety Council, meaning almost two people in every thousand are victims of slavery. Yet the British government is only aware of 17,000 registered cases of it in the UK.

""Investors aren't aware of the scale of this and just how ingrained it is - mainly because these things are often hidden from view,"" Thornton said. ""If any of us knew sometimes just how close we were to the exploitation of another person, we'd be quite horrified.

""So I think a key part of our work among investors is raising awareness. People might be aware of car washes or nail bars, but generally people have no idea. That's because it's criminal and it's hidden. It's unobservable.""

Yet despite its ubiquity, the UK has done little to prevent modern slavery compared to its peers in Europe and the US, putting British investors and consumers alike at higher risk.

The European Union made it mandatory for all companies above a certain threshold to disclose human rights due diligence under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and a forced labour ban means products tainted with forced labour cannot be sold in European markets - a far cry from the floods of slavery-linked goods still entering the UK.

Thornton and her colleague at CCLA Martin Buttle have urged the House of Lords and Cabinet Office to get UK legislation up to scratch with its peers. Not doing so could see the situation deteriorate further as illegal goods and services gravitate towards the UK and its weaker laws.

Buttle said: ""We don't currently have a UK forced labour ban or mandatory due diligence legislation. It is time now that we have similar legislation to our closest trading partners, because the risk is that without it, we become a dumping ground for these products.

""Even the US has the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act now, which it's using to great effect to stop products tainted with forced labour coming into the US.""

The need for improvement in the UK's Modern Slavery Act has been widely agreed upon since its introduced in 2016, but change has been slow to achieve. The result is a piece of legislation that is not fit for purpose and appears archaic beside its neighbours' more robust laws.

Thornton said: ""The previous government accepted the need for the Modern Slavery Act to be toughened up and tightened up, and had announced they were going to do that - they just never passed the legislation. Even Theresa May said she thinks her own legislation should be toughened up and tightened up.

""In terms of this current government, I have not yet seen what they think about due diligence. Quite a few ministers have talked about workers' rights, but the most important thing is that they address modern slavery in that too. We're really hopeful that the government will look to see what's happening in Europe.

""The real risk is if our closest trading partners have much tougher legislation, that the UK becomes a dumping ground. That's what we're very concerned about and quite a lot of the companies we have engaged with are also very aware of this risk.""

Identifying modern slavery within supply chains can be a challenge for companies in the first place, especially if they use multiple subcontractors or rely on overseas suppliers.

Yet some large-cap businesses are simply not putting enough effort into understanding where they are sourcing materials from, according to Thornton. This is not only poor governance from an ethical perspective, but not having a grasp on this basic knowledge is poor from a business and security perspective too.

""Companies that are coming up in the lower tier [ratings] - which are big companies - are not doing enough to find and understand the risks in their own supply chains, so we expect them to do more,"" Thornton said.

""We want to ensure that they have systems in place so that when they find a problem, they will address it and most importantly, they do something about the poor workers who have had their wages stolen.""

Failing to analyse supply chains is misleading to consumers who assume their products are not illegally sourced, but also puts a company's shareholders at risk.

""When we as consumers are buying things, it's really very difficult to trace them back from our purchase to the field or factory. So we utterly rely on companies to do the right thing - particularly when they've got long global supply chains,"" Thornton added.

""And as investors, we want to understand companies we have equity in because it's a material risk. It's a risk to their business because of regulation, it's a risk to their reputation, and it's ultimately a risk to their share price.

However, identifying modern slavery is the most basic aspect of preventing this growing issue. Many British companies haven't taken proactive steps to actually stop violations once they've found it, according to Buttle.

It may be this lack of action that has led the number of people in slavery globally to increase by 10 billion since the Modern Slavery Act was first introduced in 2016.

""If you look at our benchmark, the fix it element is the lowest scoring area, and many companies are not disclosing fixing it even if they are aware of cases,"" Buttle explained. ""In an ideal world, there would be some consultation with those people about what remedy they require.

""The remedy will differ depending on circumstances, but we do expect companies to consult with rights holders, with civil society organisations, and with trade unions to understand what the situation is and then putting that remedy in place. They won't always be able to do that on their own, and they will actually need to work with their peer companies because there might be a supplier that's supplying to multiple companies.""

Fixing cases of modern slavery in supply chains is not straight forward, and preventing future offenses is even more challenging. But not doing so means the problems will repeat themselves and become greater with time as we have seen, according to Thornton.

It is for this reason that the ultimate responsibility for amending this issue that has blighted the UK relies on the companies financing modern slavery.

""It's not enough just to investigate an individual case - you need to think about the systems and structures that are allowing this to happen in the first place,"" Thronton said. ""And the tremendous pressure on commercial companies to source products at the cheapest possible price, linked with vulnerable populations, is the perfect storm for people to end up in forced labour.

""That's the difficulty, and I would absolutely argue that businesses have got a huge responsibility here. ""

Ultimately, modern slavery is more rife in UK supply chains than in neighbouring nations and the government needs to ensure British businesses are not continuing to idly finance it.

Because currently, even the most ethical investor in the UK would struggle not to find traces of modern slavery within their own portfolio.

""Any investor that has a wide portfolio of companies will have exposure to it,"" Buttle said. ""And the Modern Slavery Act doesn't even include value chains or downstream risk, so investors aren't actually required to engage with companies in their portfolio because that is not a supply chain risk.

""That is one of the policy positions that we think should be mandated in law because anyone with a wide portfolio of equities will be exposed to that risk.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"Thornton, UK, Buttle, US"

supply chain risk,CDC concludes McDonald's E. coli outbreak investigation,https://www.kkco11news.com,https://www.kkco11news.com/2024/12/04/cdc-concludes-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-investigation/,"GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO) - In October slivered onions used at McDonald's triggered a deadly nationwide E. coli outbreak. Today the FDA and CDC have declared the outbreak officially over. But there's still questions looming over food safety in the future.

Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer, said, ""They all need to pay attention to what they can do to make their supply chain safer, and that's, you know, setting requirements, requiring testing, doing audits, doing inspections, you know, really paying attention to how those manufacturers and those suppliers are providing safe product.""

Marler would like to see McDonald's be more aggressive when it comes to making sure its supply chain is as safe as possible.

Said Marler, ""Making sure that its supply chain is doing everything it can do to make sure that the products that it's supplying McDonald's, especially those like onions or leafy greens, other fresh fruits and vegetables, are as safe as they can be. If McDonald's was asking me for advice, I'd have them really focus on that because that's the area where you know they're most at risk. It's their supply chain.""

The risk for contamination is greater when the produce is being grown from the ground.

Said Marler, ""Are they testing the irrigation water to see that it's actually, you know, usable and doesn't have a pathogen in it? Are they, you know, growing it in an area that's a ways away from cattle feed lots, so you don't risk, you know, air deposits of E coli that might blow in on the wind. Those are the things that, you know, that McDonald's and other big box retailers and restaurants need to do to protect the public.""

One way for consumers to know if where they want to eat is a safe spot is to check the restaurant's inspection report. You can check those reports online typically but don't let one bad report end your time there.

Said Marler, ""One bad report isn't really a death nail for a restaurant. But if you see a pattern of repeated failures, I think that's probably the place you might want to avoid.""",,,,N/A,N/A,"Colo., GRAND JUNCTION"
supply chain risk,Martial law incident raises caution over Korean investments: S&P Global Ratings,중앙일보,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-12-04/business/economy/Martial-law-incident-raises-caution-over-Korean-investments-SP-Global-Ratings/2192596,"President Yoon Suk Yeol's overnight declaration and subsequent lifting of martial law is likely to heighten foreign investors' caution in Korea, credit experts of S&P Global Ratings said on Wednesday.

The country's sovereign rating, on the other hand, is expected to remain unaffected.

""Risk in Korea in that kind of matter really wasn't on companies' minds,"" said Andy Liu, S&P Global Ratings' managing director of corporate ratings in the Asia-Pacific region, during a news conference ahead of a joint credit outlook seminar co-hosted by S&P Global Ratings and NICE Investors Service in western Seoul.

""Given that it happened, it will probably cause some of the [corporations] to think about and re-evaluate supply chain risk, financial risk, policy risks,"" Liu suggested.

""Could that affect how the companies behave in terms of what they think the right balance sheet should be, what their capital expenditures should be, and where that could take place? I think it is definitely affirmative.""

While also noting that the short-term impact on actual business operations and plans would be limited given the prompt resolution, Liu stressed that the next six to nine months would be crucial for Korea to regain confidence in its political and financial stability.

Ki Tae-hoon, director of NICE Investors Service's ratings policy division, said the latest incident ""may have a short-term impact on the financial market and, in particular, on [Korea's] external credit and brand image,"" but expected the brief shock would eventually wear off.

""As fundamentals of the corporate or financial sector appear solid, I believe [the market] will gradually recover from the political instability,"" said Ki.

Korea's sovereign credit rating, on the other hand, will remain unaffected, according to S&P's Kim Eng Tan, senior director of sovereign and international public finance ratings.

""From our perspective, the high AA rating that we have on the Korean sovereignty, I think, to a large extent, reflects our expectations that things will be more or less strong within the Korean institutions as it is,"" said Tan.

Although the director noted that the incident would come as ""a negative shock"" that may impact the decisions of international investors, he said, ""We don't see any need for us to change the rating.""

supply chain risk,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $303.5 Million Loan Guarantee to Eos Energy Enterprises to Advance Next Generation Battery Energy Storage Systems  | AltEnergyMag,altenergymag.com,https://www.altenergymag.com/story/2024/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-3035-million-loan-guarantee-to-eos-energy-enterprises-to-advance-next-generation-battery-energy-storage-systems/43873/,"As a part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its Loan Programs Office (LPO), today announced the closing of a $303.5 million loan guarantee ($277.5 million of principal and $26 million of capitalized interest) to Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (Eos) to finance the construction of two state-of-the-art production lines that will be able to produce enough stationary batteries per year to annual electricity needs of approximately 130,000 homes. These facilities will produce ""Eos Z3™,"" a next-generation utility- and industrial-scale zinc-bromine battery energy storage systems (BESS) in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Pending additional LPO approvals and completion of an Environmental Assessment pursuant to NEPA, two additional lines in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, may also be included as part of the loan guarantee. Today's announcement underscores DOE's commitment to fostering innovative energy solutions while creating good-paying, high-quality jobs across America.

""The Biden-Harris Administration has successfully implemented a new economic playbook that has boosted America's competitive standing on the world stage as an innovation leader in the cutting-edge technologies of the future,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennfier M. Granholm. ""Today's announcement will bolster the nation's energy security while ensuring President Biden's manufacturing boom continues to deliver for generations to come.""

All four lines of the project are expected to manufacture 8 GWh of storage capacity annually by 2027, or enough to provide electricity to over 300,000 average U.S. homes instantaneously or meet the annual electricity needs of approximately 130,000 homes if fully charged and discharged daily. The project is expected to create and maintain up to 1000 jobs including both salaried employees and a well-paid manufacturing workforce, unionized by the United Steelworkers -- boosting the regional economy and adding to the 16 million jobs created since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office.

Grid-scale storage allows utilities and industrial customers to store energy when there is a surplus and use it when energy is relatively more expensive or supply is unavailable. BESS can provide numerous grid functions, including an alternative to fossil fuel electricity generation during demand spikes, being a lower-cost option during normal demand, and providing backup power. Today's energy storage market is nascent but rapidly growing and is dominated by lithium-ion and lithium iron phosphate battery technologies, which typically serve short-term duration applications (approximately 4 hours).

Eos's zinc-bromine Eos Z3™ batteries provide alternative battery chemistry to lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium redox chemistries for stationary battery storage applications. Eos's technology is also specifically designed for long-duration grid-scale stationary battery storage that can assist in meeting the energy grids' growing demand with increasing amounts of renewable energy penetration. Critically, Eos batteries are non-flammable and do not require active cooling to operate. The batteries can achieve 100% depth of discharge, do not degrade based on age, and are rated for 6,000 charge/discharge cycles before degradation. LPO financing will support manufacturing Eos's generation battery system, the Eos Z3, which are more energy dense and cost-efficient to produce than Eos's previous models.

Over time, Eos expects to source nearly 100% of the materials supply for the Eos Z3 battery from the United States. The product is also better insulated from market volatility and supply chain risk that challenge other battery chemistries by forgoing scarce critical minerals such as lithium, which are largely imported.

LPO works with all borrowers to create good-paying jobs with strong labor standards during construction, operations, and throughout the life of the loan including developing strong and binding Community Benefits Plans. The jobs created by the project would be based primarily in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania, with hourly wages paid at least at the prevailing wage and competitive internship and apprenticeship salaries.

As a part of its Community Benefits Plan, Eos is engaged in ongoing community outreach efforts to economic and workforce development leaders, educational institutions, and state and local governments -- including Allegheny Conference on Community Development and its economic development affiliate the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, The Heinz Endowment and The Mon Metro Chamber of Commerce, among others -- to ensure community participation in the project and to attract a strong local workforce. Eos has created a Clean Energy Careers Program to target local high schools, vocational schools, and trade schools to attract students to apprenticeship opportunities; to provide internship opportunities for 2- or 4-year college and high school students to learn skills from Eos welders, chemical engineers, and other professionals, opening up potential long-term career pathways for those students; and to raise awareness of career opportunities at Eos with local veteran groups, literacy centers, and within the nonprofit community.

Turtle Creek and nearby communities are disadvantaged communities (DACs), and the project is situated on a former Westinghouse Electric Corporation campus. The company's current workforce is diverse across race, gender, and veteran status, and Eos is committed to growing its diverse, equitable, and inclusive team. The project's support for disadvantaged communities and their workers aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal to ensure at least 40% of overall the benefits of federal clean energy investments flow to DOE-identified DACs that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.

The loan guarantee is offered through LPO's Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program, which includes financing opportunities for innovative energy and supply chain projects like Eos's and certain state-supported projects and projects that reinvest in existing energy infrastructure.

Across all LPO's new and improved programs, DOE has attracted 212 active applications for projects across the country totaling over $324.35 billion in requested loans and loan guarantees, as of the end of November.
