Implementing Supplier Segmentation for Better Management and Financial Control,supplychainbrain.com,https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40666-implementing-supplier-segmentation-for-better-management-and-financial-control,"The proper management of supplier relationships is key to maintaining efficiency and driving success for your manufacturing business. It requires vigilance, collaboration, and time -- that last item a rarity across all industrial sectors.

Supplier segmentation is the process of placing suppliers into specific groups. While unique to each manufacturer, it has a common framework that, when used with the right tools, can help manage suppliers more efficiently, reduce risk, and maintain stronger financial control.

Too many manufacturers treat suppliers interchangeably. In reality, each supplier has unique strengths in addressing specific needs, such as parts manufacturing or staffing agencies.

Not all suppliers deliver the same levels of service. Some will prove to be more efficient than others, provide better customer service, or offer better discounts or pricing packages. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each supplier is critical for long-term success.

Segmenting suppliers brings multiple benefits. Firstly, by breaking suppliers into specified categories, a business can uncover greater supply chain insights and see if there are risks, such as too much dependency on a single supplier for a critical component or ingredient.

Secondly, you can identify consistently reliable suppliers by segmenting based on performance. Such a metric extends to quality, timeliness and maybe even the ability to get you out of a pinch. With studies attributing $82 million in annual losses due to supply chain disruption, the value of segmentation in helping to identify reliable partners and reduce shipment delays becomes clear.

To make supplier segmentation work, you first need an effective strategy. It starts with the gathering and analysis of data. Factors to consider include delivery time, price, payment history and geographic location of each supplier.

It's equally important to consider qualitative data. Is the supplier reliable? Does it communicate effectively? Is a given relationship likely to become more important in future? Incorporate all information impacting the end-to-end process, from initial transactions to strategic initiatives.

Of course, data alone isn't sufficient. You need the right tools to unpack your data into usable insights. Modern supplier analytics platforms help to centralize information for quick access to comprehensive information.

Some tools utilize artificial intelligence to predict supplier and supply chain trends. AI can utilize qualitative and external information to make predictions about how, for example, the rainfall in Panama might impact the Panama Canal, or whether increasing international tensions will impact trade routes and tariffs.

Setting Objectives and Goals

Segmenting without objectives won't get you very far. At the start of your strategy, allot some time to introspection. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of your current dealings with suppliers. How can segmentation help to strengthen your approach?

As with setting any targets in your organization, it's important to follow the SMART framework. This means that your segmentation objectives should be:

As an element of Lean Six Sigma initiatives, SMART goals are a proven method. If your goal, say, is to increase your on-time, in-full (OTIF) order percentage, you need to have a realistic number to aim for. The SMART goal technique will increase your odds of achieving it.

Aligning Segmentation With Business Strategy

You've identified a clear set of goals. But which forms of segmentation can help you to reach them?

Think of a business looking to improve its OTIF percentage. In this instance, it makes sense to segment suppliers based on their delivery performance metric, as it directly impacts yours.

Of course, you don't have to segment based on just one metric. You can apply further segmentations to your data to create more granular results.

For example, a small manufacturing business will likely want to balance costs and risk factors. As such, it would need to pull more specific and relevant reports from its accounting and operations management software to further segment the data, and find a supplier that meets its long-term financial and reputational needs.\

Creating a Segmentation Matrix

A segmentation matrix helps you to categorize suppliers into different groups. The best example is the Kraljic matrix, named after academic and author Peter Kraljic. Monitoring this model can help you assign supplier scorecards more effectively. The model plots value versus spend and splits suppliers into four different quadrants:

This segmentation model will not be applicable to every business. Think about your company's unique needs and objectives. Consider how you can apply them to your segmentation matrix.

Communicating With Suppliers

The importance of supplier communication cannot be overstated. Yet many manufacturers struggle to build a strong rapport with their numerous suppliers. This can lead to miscommunication around order quantities, delivery dates and other key areas. It also increases the chances of disputes emerging, which further damages relationships and can impact cash flow.

Communication should be a key part of your segmentation strategy. One example is to use a sentiment analysis tool to analyze previous communications. This can identify whether the language used was positive, negative or neutral. By segmenting based on positive communications, you can identify suppliers with a history of positive dialogue with your organization.

You should also collaborate with your purchasing and operations leaders for further feedback. Additionally, exploring negative communications could help in fixing a potential issue before it gets worse.

Response rate is another useful area to consider. In the ever-moving world of business, swift response times are critical. Are suppliers getting back to you quickly, or leaving you hanging for a response? Segmenting based on response times can help you prioritize efficient communication.

Segmentation shouldn't apply only to existing suppliers. Consider using your supplier segmentation criteria when choosing new suppliers. Examples might include segmentation based on:

Monitoring Progress against KPIs

Recall the ""M"" in SMART: it stands for ""measurable"". It's important to assign a key set of metrics to assess progress toward your goals. Following are some of the key performance indicators that can be useful in supplier segmentation.

Reviewing and Adjusting Segmentation

Your approach to segmentation shouldn't be static. Business needs and priorities change over time. As they do, it's important to bring your segmentation in line with your updated strategic objectives.

Review your segmentation efforts regularly. Consider how you can alter your tactics to produce accurate and effective segments. Are you tracking the right areas? Are segments based on sufficiently detailed data to provide you with accurate insights? Are you tracking the correct metrics to monitor your progress?

The management of supplier relationships is a team effort, and worth the time investment. With the proper tools at hand, supplier segmentation can reduce risk, and in the long term save the company time."
"Thar Coal, once touted as the end to reliance on LNG, is capable of producing its own natural gas. What will it take? - Profit by Pakistan Today",Profit by Pakistan Today,https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/12/09/thar-coal-once-touted-as-the-end-to-reliance-on-lng-is-capable-of-producing-its-own-natural-gas-what-will-it-take/,"When the first Thar Plant went live in 2019, it was supposed to reduce Pakistan's reliance on imported gas. What does it mean if Thar's Lignite can be gassified?

On a hot April afternoon in 2019, Pakistan fired up its first ever power plant fueled by domestic coal. The shiny new plant, run by the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, was the sort of project bureaucrats, politicians, and development sector flunkies dream about and doodle the name of in their secret diaries.

For starters, it was the first to exploit the 175 billion tonnes of lignite that was spread across the 900 km2 coal fields in Tharparkar, which is possibly the second largest coal reserve in the world.

Check.

The project was being run through a public-private partnership between the Sindh Government and Engro Corporation, which is by far one of the most responsible organisations in corporate Pakistan.

Double check.

And the real kicker? Engro's Thar Project came under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor with $50 billion of proposed investment in infrastructure projects. At the time this was one of the most talked about projects in terms of how China's Belt and Road Initiative was impacting the global energy landscape.

The Thar Coal fields had first been discovered in 1991 through a joint mission (we used that term very liberally) of the Pakistan Geological Survey and the United States Agency for International Development. With an estimated 175 billion tonnes of lignite, the Thar Coal Fields have the capacity to produce 100,000 MW of electricity for the next 200 years.

To put that into perspective, as of now the largest coal reserves in the world exist in the USA with just under 250 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.

The opportunity to exploit the coal fields was massive. The world was becoming wiser to the dangers of fossil fuels by the 1990s, but energy consumption still operated like the Wild West. But developing Thar Coal would take time, money, and a lot of technical assistance. And in the time between 1991 and 2019, Pakistan's energy mix became a mess. Up until the 1990s, the largest source of electricity in Pakistan was hydel. But as demand for power grew and the desire to make new dams evaporated, the government increasingly began relying on imports.

In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, these imports came in the form of furnace oil used by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). From 2013 onwards, Pakistan was relying on importing coal for the coal plants set up by the third Nawaz Administration in Punjab, as well as allowing the private sector to import LNG.

Of course there was a problem with this. Imported sources of fuel tend to get expensive, especially when you do not have a strong export oriented economy. Energy prices in Pakistan were dependent on the whims and stability of the international market and the global order. So much so that by the time Engro's plant went live in 2019, it was S&P Global reported on it with the headline ""Pakistan's Thar wager pits coal against LNG in its power mix.""

Thar Coal was supposed to be the answer to Pakistan's reliance on LNG and other imported sources of fuel. At least to some extent. While it was not clean fuel, it was cheap, domestic, and readily available. The idea was that you would set up more plants close to Thar and figure out how to transport coal to other regions. However, as time has proven, transporting Thar Coal and setting up power plants in the Thar region is not the easiest task in the world. And for many years now, one fantasy has persisted somewhere in the collective hive-mind of our policymakers: turning Thar Coal into gas that can feed our thermal power plants and replace the crippling need for LNG.

Now, a recent study has indicated this can be done in an economically feasible way. However, it is not the first time the government has tried to cash in on the concept of turning Thar's Lignite into gas. And it did not go very well the first time around.

The potential of Thar Coal

It is a simple problem. Pakistan relies heavily on imported fuel sources such as reliquified natural gas (RLNG) to produce electricity. Whenever there is an international crisis, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Pakistan's energy sector is rocked by the ripple effect. There is a simple solution. Cheaper fuel -- something like coal perhaps. And the source is right there too. Spread over more than 9000 km2, the Thar coal fields are one of the largest deposits of lignite coal in the world -- with an estimated 175 billion tonnes of coal that according to some could solve Pakistan's energy woes for, not decades, but centuries to come.

Currently, Pakistan produces around 2600 MW of electricity through Thar Coal. Just over five years ago, this figure was zero. The total reserves from Thar Coal are more than the combined oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Iran. The reserves are around 68 times higher than Pakistan's total gas reserves. Compared to this potential the current utilisation of Thar Coal in the total power generation mix is around 10% which means that there is huge opportunity to expand in this sphere.

But as of now, imported fuel continues to be a big force in Pakistan's electricity mix. What matters is that we are currently in a situation where we are dependent on RLNG. When RLNG was introduced into Pakistan's energy mix, it was relatively cheaper and also environmentally friendlier than coal. Although long-term agreements with Qatar still provide gas at a relatively affordable rate, the spot market is a blood bath. Pakistan has been turning more and more to the spot market to address the growing local demand for gas.

The average cost of gas is rising at a very rapid pace due to the Ukraine war and subsequent global supply chain disruption. It is an issue Profit has covered in the past. During the Nawaz administration, the government decided to increase the generation capacity cheaply at the risk of it getting expensive later, which it has now. By 2022, the increased reliance on both imported coal and LNG, Pakistan was generating just over 52% of its electricity from purely domestic sources. That was down from 84% in 2005, and 71% as recently as 2012. This made Pakistan's market more vulnerable to the whims of the international market. This has only gotten worse. According to data from NEPRA, thermal power plants running on imported fuels accounted for roughly 62% of Pakistan's generation capacity in fiscal year 2022-23, with fuel costs alone representing an overwhelming 83% of the total generation expense. This heavy reliance on imports leaves the nation's energy security at the mercy of global markets and exchange rates, an increasingly untenable position as the Pakistani rupee continues to slide against the U.S. dollar. Efforts to mitigate these costs, such as allowing coal imports from Afghanistan, have been undercut by the dollar-based payment system, negating any potential savings.

However, when it comes to the use of Thar Coal, there are some possibilities. The proportion of imported coal in the generation mix declined in FY 2022-23 as compared to FY 2021-22, owing to the introduction of more plants utilizing locally sourced coal, including ThalNova Power Thar (Pvt.) Limited, Thar Energy Limited, and Thar Coal Block-I Power Generation Company (Pvt.) Limited, facilitated by Shanghai Electric. In the case of recently commissioned Thar Coal power plants, the availability of the transmission line was delayed.

At the same time the country's indigenous energy resources -- hydropower, local coal, wind, and solar -- remain underdeveloped or face significant production declines. These dependencies, coupled with a weakening currency and rising global interest rates, are driving electricity costs to unsustainable levels for a country already burdened by economic instability.

Shifting to domestic

Now, those that have gone all in on Thar Coal will tell you it is the solution to all of Pakistan's electricity problems. The difference in the cost of producing electricity from domestic coal and imported coal is substantial. The cost of producing electricity from the Engro plant, which uses domestic Thar coal, is Rs 10.44/kWh, whereas the Lucky Electric plant which uses the same type of coal (lignite) but imports it costs Rs 20.92/kWh, according to data from Nepra's latest monthly fuel cost adjustment report.

But the Lucky Plant has failed to gain access to Thar Coal. In a recent state of the industry report, NEPRA claimed challenges remain.

Currently, the local coal-based power plants rely on coal from Block-I and Block-II of Thar Coal. The development of Block-II has progressed through its envisioned three phases, but financial closure for Phase-III is still pending. Notably, Lucky Electric Power's 660 MW project, primarily a Thar Coal based project, operates on a blend of Thar Coal and Imported Coal due to delayed Thar Coal supply.

You have a situation where the requirement is to have more coal plants that can produce electricity through the lignite that is available in Thar, and you need to find cheap ways of transporting it. This challenge has persisted, and even though Thar Coal has come a long way in the past decade, one dream that has remained in the backdrop is the idea to turn coal into gas.

Turning coal into gas

Let us start by getting one thing straight, this is yet another pipe-dream that the government of Pakistan has. They believe that if Thar Coal can be converted into gas in an economically feasible way, they will be able to transport this gas through an extensive network of pipelines and provide it to all kinds of gas consumers. It will essentially be a replacement for expensive and volatile LNG and will do the same job. Almost like discovering new gas reserves.

Of course, this huge network of pipelines does not exist. There is no gas pipeline in Thar currently, and all of this infrastructure will have to be built. But what if they can pull it off? Coal gasification is a process that transforms coal into synthetic natural gas.

Coal gasification and liquefaction technologies have been around since the 18th century. Their supporters argue that they are relatively less harmful to the environment than directly burning coal for energy. Their critics allege that these technologies have massive capital and operational costs and are too complex to operate smoothly.

It is a scientifically doable process, but not all kinds of coal have the composition to be turned into gas in an economically feasible manner. The process is simple enough. Coal is pulverized and mixed with an oxidant, such as steam, air, or oxygen, in a gasifier vessel at high temperatures and pressures. This process creates syngas. The syngas is cooled and cleaned to remove impurities like sulfur, mercury, and particulate matter. The syngas is separated into streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is cleaned and ready for use. The carbon dioxide is captured and sequestered. Not only is this method possible, it is also cleaner than burning coal. The cleaned syngas can be burned in a gas turbine to generate electricity. At the same time, the hydrogen byproduct of the process can be used to make ammonia, fertilizer, or refine oil.

But can Thar's lignite be turned into gas? The question was first seriously addressed in 2013, when Pakistan hosted an international conference on coal. One result of this was a gasification project led by Dr Samar Mubarakmand. It was supposed to turn in its findings around 2016, but by 2018 there had been no headway. In fact, in the five years this project had been operational, the government managed to produce exactly 8MW of electricity from coal gasification after spending Rs 3.4 billion.

Now, this is not necessarily an amount that would not be worth it. The SC and other bodies often see figures like this and think they point to corruption. How can you only produce 8MW of electricity in Rs 3.4 billion? The answer is, if the purpose was to prove that Thar Cola can be used to efficiently make gas that can be burned into electricity, then the research and development costs of these projects can be much higher as well, and with no guarantee of a good result. But the issue obviously became a huge kerfuffle.

And in case you have not guessed it, in October 2018 the Chief Justice was the Honourable Justice (Thankfully Retired) Saqib Nisar. He very quickly directed the prosecutor general National Accountability Bureau to investigate Dr Mubarakmand and other officials for producing only 8MW electricity despite spending Rs 3.4 billion on the project.

Remember, there were no irregularities here. Dr Samar Mubarakmand, had conceived the idea of generating 100MW electricity through underground coal gasification. The science and technology department of the Planning Commission had approved the project for 100MW electricity to be generated through the UCG. Its cost was Rs 9 billion and was scheduled to be completed within two years.

Clearly this did not happen. In five years only 8MW were produced at a cost of Rs 3.4 billion. However, the project faced many delays. After digging through the receipts, Profit discovered that the project was launched in October 2012. For the first year-and-a-half, the project went into hibernation. It finally got up and running when the planning commission's science department released Rs 90 crore. Later, Rs 1 billion was released in 2013-14 and Rs 1 billion for the project were released in 2014-15. The project was then transferred to the energy department of the planning commission, which released Rs 36 crores and then completely stopped funding in 2016-17. So by the time Saqib Nisar got around to wagging his honourable finger at Dr Mubarkamand, the project had been out of commission for a couple of years. On top of this, it had also been passed around within the planning commission.

Obviously annoyed that NAB was knocking on his door, said that he only gave technical inputs on the Thar coal gasification project through research and he did not have any financial powers. Once again, this is how experimental projects work. But after this, the Thar coal-to-gas dream seemed to be dead in its tracks.

Could it still be done?

That is until last month. In early November, new study, conducted by a group of energy experts led by Dr Farid Malik claimed that gas produced from Thar coal would be cheaper than the imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and could help reduce the price of fuel and electricity for residential and commercial users. Dr Malik, an energy and technology management expert who is currently an adviser to the Sindh government, said the evaluations and laboratory tests conducted by Nelson Mandela University, South Africa, found that Thar coal was suitable for gasification. He estimated that the Thar coal gasification could reduce gas prices in Pakistan by 30 to 60%.

The price of imported LNG was fluctuating between $14-20 per mmBtu at that point, and this new study claimed that the gas produced from Thar Coal could be as low as $7-8 per mmBtu.

It is worth mentioning that this is a very flamboyant statement with no substantial working behind it. Many things have been assumed to come to this point, and the details of the calculation have not been shared. It is definitely posturing, and the reality will clearly be quite different. But the fact is that if it is even a little lower than the price of imported LNG, Pakistan will be able to at least have stability when it comes to energy prices rather than being dependent on the fluctuations of the market. And as far as the possibility of pulling this off is concerned, the test results show that Thar coal has an ash content of around 18pc and an ash flow temperature range of around 1,325°C, which makes it suitable for gasification. The carbon reactivity is also high, which is typical of lignite coal. The expected pure gas yield is between 1,550-1,600 cubic metres per tonne.

So does that mean the initial effort by Dr Mubarkmand had gotten something wrong? Well, the running explanation of the new study is that the technology required for coal gasification has gotten better at breakneck speed. Dr Malik attributed this to the increasing trend of countries like Germany moving towards hydrogen energy from coal gasification, which has made gasifiers cheaper.

As a result of the study, the Sindh Coal Authority is striving to woo private investment to finance the country's first coal-to-gas project to initially produce 100mmcfd to 200mmcfd of gas from coal in the Thar desert. This is already an improvement from the 2013 experiment, when the planning commission made the effort a public service project. The private investment required to buy around 20 gasifiers and get this thing up and running is around $10 million, as claimed by Dr Malik.

There are plenty of opportunities here. For starters, Engro is already involved in Thar Coal through the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company. It might make sense for Engro particularly because they are also in the fertiliser industry, and one of the byproducts of turning coal into gas is the production of fertiliser. The project would produce both electricity and fertiliser.

""We intend to buy 20 gasifiers, small modular plants each with a capacity to produce 10 million British thermal units (mmBtu) of syngas, from a source in Europe for this project."" Dr Malik said in an earlier comment given to the media. His plan is to buy two-decade old gasifiers from Europe, where they are upgrading their machinery on a very large scale. These second-hand gasifiers, which can work on Thar's lignite as proven in the South Africa based study, will then be used to make this initial gas from the Lignite.

The fertiliser equation

One of the big angles here is the idea of making integrated production facilities that will make both fertilisers and synthetic gas. Pakistan's fertiliser industry is already in a bit of a tough spot because of the lack of cheap or subsidised gas, which is necessary for its manufacturing. At the beginning of this year, the government under the direction of the IMF had begun a process to rationalise gas prices, including to industries.

There is a reason the IMF wants to increase gas prices in Pakistan. Very briefly put, Pakistan does not have a lot of gas but we use it like we do. The IMF, as part of the ongoing programme, wanted to increase the price of gas for all domestic and commercial consumers. You see, Pakistanis have gas cross subsidised. This means that the natural gas we produce is given to different consumers at different rates. There is one category of protected consumers which get it at the cheapest possible rate. These are small domestic consumers that use gas below a certain amount and tandoors that make rotis. Even within this protected category there are slabs and everyone is charged differently based on how much they consume. Essentially, bigger consumers end up subsidising smaller consumers. While this is a people friendly policy and popular for political decision makers, it is also unproductive.

Commercial connection rates were raised by 136%, and the biggest increase was in the cement sector which saw a hike of around 193%. Meanwhile the fertiliser industry saw a gas price hike of 175% as well this year. The subsidy of Rs 39 billion on feed and fuel gas for Engro Fertilisers was withdrawn and the ECC approved a new rate of Rs1,597 per mmbtu.

Dr. Malik outlines two potential approaches to coal gasification: converting coal into synthetic gas (syngas) to produce fertilizers directly at an integrated plant near the mining site, or transforming coal into syngas and further into synthetic natural gas (SNG) for distribution through an extensive pipeline network.

He emphasizes that the primary focus of authorities is leveraging the Thar coal gasification project to boost fertilizer production by encouraging investment in integrated urea manufacturing plants. ""We are currently facing a shortfall of 2-3 million tonnes of urea due to dwindling gas supplies for fertilizer production, forcing us to rely on imports,"" Dr. Malik explains. ""Prioritizing the first approach is essential for ensuring food security.""

But a problem continues here. The plan to turn Thar's lignite into coal is still a pipedream. All we know for sure is that in some world, theoretically, it can be done. It is possible and even feasible. The government definitely does not have the money to pursue this, which is why they are looking for investors. But gasification is already a tainted project. If Dr Samar Mubarkamand, a celebrated scientist who was a researcher not an investor, can be hounded by NAB and summoned to court for not getting results, why would investors have the confidence to jump into this project? It is something Dr Malik has admitted, telling Dawn in an interview last month that ""The business environment in the country is pretty hostile. Then, we have a big import lobby working against this project."""
How Companies Can Guard Against A Tariff-Related Supply Chain Crisis,expertclick.com,"https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/How-Companies-Can-Guard-Against-A-TariffRelated-Supply-Chain-Crisis,2024308090.aspx","Commentary by Edward Segal, a crisis management expert and author of Crisis Ahead: 101 Ways to Prepare for and Bounce Back from Disasters, Scandals, and Other Emergencies.

The nation's fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

""These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,"" Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That's because ""once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,"" according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

Proactive Measures

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

Seek Supply Chain Alternatives

""Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump''s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

""Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,"" she pointed out.

Stockpile Inventory

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,"" Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

Diversify

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,"" he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,"" Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

Manage Financial Impact

""Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,"" Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

Plan Ahead

""Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,"" he commented.

Challenges

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

""A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn't changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,"" the report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

""The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,"" according to the survey results.

Fewer Discussions

""Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,"" the report pointed out.

""If you're not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you're flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,"" Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,"" advised in an email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

""At the end of the day, this isn't just about tariffs. It's about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It's about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously -- invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships -- will not just weather the storm; they'll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,"" he commented.

Evolve

""Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,"" Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Businesses who don't take steps now to protect themselves as much as possible from a tariff-related supply chain crisis will only have themselves to blame if and when it -- or another crisis -- strikes."

This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,"" Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,"" he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,"" Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

""Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,"" Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

""Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,"" he commented.

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

""A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn't changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,"" the report observed.

""The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,"" according to the survey results.

""Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,"" the report pointed out.

""If you're not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you're flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,"" Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,"" advised in an email interview.

""At the end of the day, this isn't just about tariffs. It's about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It's about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously -- invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships -- will not just weather the storm; they'll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,"" he commented.

""Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,"" Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Businesses who don't take steps now to protect themselves as much as possible from a tariff-related supply chain crisis will only have themselves to blame if and when it -- or another crisis -- strikes."
Bills sponsored by Reps. Curtis and Maloy get green light in House,Daily Herald,https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/2024/dec/07/bills-sponsored-by-reps-curtis-and-maloy-get-green-light-in-house/,"Spenser Heaps for Utah News DispatchThe Colorado River is pictured near Moab on Sunday, Feb. 18, 2024.

Utahns in Congress are seeing some success during the U.S. House of Representatives' lame-duck session.

On Tuesday, the House passed two bills sponsored by Rep. Celeste Maloy and two bills sponsored by Rep. John Curtis, both Republicans.

From transferring several plots of federal land to state control, to putting more federal dollars behind water quality projects in the Colorado River, here's a breakdown of what the bills do.

The House on Tuesday passed Curtis' Colorado River Salinity Control Fix Act, which will put more federal funds behind efforts to reduce salinity in the lower Colorado River basin.

If the bill passes the Senate, the federal government will shoulder the burden of expenses for projects related to reducing salinity. Federal dollars would amount to at least 70% of funds spent on salinity mitigation and in some cases, 100% of operation and maintenance costs.

Most of the salinity in the river basin comes from existing rock formations. Precipitation breaks down the salts, carrying them into streams and eventually the Colorado River. Higher salinity levels limit what crops farmers can grow, reduces crop yields, damages riparian areas and harms the aquatic ecosystem of the river.

Congress passed the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act in 1974, which directed the U.S. Department of Interior to create a salinity control program for the entire Colorado River basin. For example, in one stretch of Colorado's Dolores River along the Utah border, rock formations deposit about 150,000 tons of salt into the basin each year. A U.S. Bureau of Reclamation project works to take that salt and inject it underground.

But with Colorado River flows declining and salinity increasing, Curtis said the act needed a facelift so the federal government could chip in more for projects spearheaded by local water conservancy districts and use local or state funds.

""The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the West, and its health is crucial for our communities, our economy, and our environment,"" Curtis said in a statement. ""The Colorado River Salinity Control Fix Act builds on decades of collaborative efforts to reduce salinity levels, which have greatly improved water quality across the Basin.""

Also passed on Tuesday was a bill sponsored by Maloy, titled The Utah State Parks Adjustment Act. The bill would put several parcels of federally controlled land in and around three Utah State Parks under Utah control.

The bill would convey three parcels of land (currently under the purview of the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service) to Utah to be included as part of Antelope Island State Park, Wasatch Mountain State Park, and Fremont Indian State Park. It would require Utah to use the lands for public purposes, including parks, campgrounds, recreation and permitted livestock grazing.

All of these parcels are either in holdings or located directly next to existing Utah State Park boundaries, according to Maloy's office, which included maps of the proposed land transfers in a news release.

""Utah State Parks, managed by Utahns with a deep knowledge of the land, are well cared for and maintained,"" Maloy said in a prepared statement. ""However, having federal lands interspersed throughout these parks has made effective management more challenging. I'm pleased to see the House pass the Utah State Parks Adjustment Act, returning these land parcels to state control.""

The Senate has yet to consider the legislation, though Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has introduced a companion bill. He issued a statement Tuesday calling the House's passage of Maloy's bill ""an encouraging win for all Utahns"" that ""demonstrates what we can accomplish when local voices are at the forefront.""

""I look forward to advancing this bill in the Senate to return these parcels to state control, streamline land management, and empower Utahns to steward the lands they know and love,"" Lee said.

Another bill sponsored by Curtis passed the House on Tuesday -- the Recognizing the Importance of Critical Minerals in Healthcare Act, which amends the Energy Act of 2020.

Now, the Secretary of the Interior will be required to consult the Secretary of Health and Human Services when designating critical minerals, elements, substances and materials.

The federal government defines a critical mineral as something that has ""a high risk of supply chain disruption"" and ""serves an essential function in one or more energy technologies, including technologies that produce, transmit, store, and conserve energy.""

Now, with the Department of Health and Human Services looped into these designations, Curtis says the country's health care system will be better suited to avoid potential disruptions.

""By including the Department of Health and Human Services in decisions about critical minerals, we can make sure essential medical technologies -- like MRIs -- are never at risk of shortages,"" he said in a statement.

The House on Tuesday also passed a bill sponsored by Maloy and Curtis, HR 8666, which would authorize more federal case locations in Moab and Monticello, rural areas in southeastern Utah.

Today, the Central Division of the District of Utah within the U.S. District Court has existing court locations including in Ogden, Salt Lake City, Provo and St. George.

""Residents of Southeast Utah called to federal jury duty are regularly excused due to hardship because the travel requirement is so unwieldy,"" the Judicial Conference of the United States wrote in a July letter expressing support for the bill. ""The addition of Moab and Monticello as places of holding court will provide the district flexibility to fashion solutions to service its remote areas, including the option to adopt a jury plan that would make jury service less burdensome for residents.""

The changes proposed by the bill would also come at no cost, according to the Judicial Conference, noting ""the district has agreements with state/county courthouses in Moab and Monticello for the use of their facilities at no cost.""

""Without this bill authorizing court proceedings in Moab and Monticello, southeastern Utahns must drive several hours to appear before a federal judge or serve jury duty,"" Maloy said in a prepared statement. ""I'm glad the House passed this bill allowing the Central Division of the District of Utah to hold court in these rural areas, which would save Utahns time and money.""

Curtis also issued a prepared statement, saying it's ""essential"" that ""Utahns have equal access to justice.""

""This bill addresses the challenges that southeastern Utah residents face, harkening back to the values of our pioneer ancestors who laid the foundation of our great state,"" Curtis said. ""Just as they built communities, we must ensure that the justice system serves all Utahns, no matter where they live. With this bill's passage, we can ensure that rural Utahns have fair opportunities for a speedy trial and can fulfill their civic duties without undue burden."""
"'National security is the foundation for growth,' defence secretary launches new strategy to boost UK jobs and growth - Caribbean News Global",Caribbean News Global,https://caribbeannewsglobal.com/national-security-is-the-foundation-for-growth-defence-secretary-launches-new-strategy-to-boost-uk-jobs-and-growth/,"LONDON, England - UK based defence firms will be prioritised for government investment under a new defence industrial strategy that will drive economic growth, boost British jobs and strengthen national security.

Defence Secretary, John Healey on Monday 2 December launched the Government's Defence Industrial Strategy - by inviting investors, innovators, industry and trade unions to give their views on how to grow a better, more integrated, more innovative and more resilient defence sector.

Speaking at a London Defence Conference event with investors in London, Healey will set an ambition to increase defence sector jobs in ""every nation and region of the UK"". A strong defence sector can help provide ""the foundation for a decade of national renewal,"" Healey said. And will publish a new Statement of Intent for the Defence Industrial Strategy.

With global threats increasing, the Government's Defence Industrial Strategy will place deterrence at the heart of a new approach, to ensure adversaries know the UK has an industrial base that can innovate at a wartime pace.

In a sign of the government's commitment to develop a faster, more resilient supply chain, a first-of-its-kind wargame will begin today with the UK defence industry. The wargame will explore how industry and the MOD could sustain personnel on the frontline when faced with constant supply chain disruption and intense fighting.

The strategy will help make the defence sector an engine for UK growth and will strengthen domestic supply chains in critical areas, such as semi-conductors and steel. The new government has already invested in the acquisition of a defence semiconductor factory in County Durham. The new strategy will show how public investment and long-term certainty can help crowd-in billions in private investment into UK Defence and will ""mobilise the private sector to help face down global threats.""

In a show of support for this approach, Mondays announcement comes as defence companies announce major new investments and facilities, helping boost jobs and growth across Britain.

Minister for defence procurement and industry, Maria Eagle, will also visit Barrow-in-Furness on Monday where BAE Systems' skilled workers are building the UK's new nuclear submarines and will benefit from the further investment.

The new government is seeking to address some of the problems of the past which have held back growth in the defence sector, including inefficient spending, skills shortages, a lack of focus on exports and long-term partnerships. The government will deliver for British businesses and the public through this step-change in approach.

At the centre of the strategy is the government's growth mission - bringing benefits to every region and nation in the UK. The defence sector already supports 1 in 60 jobs in the UK - 434,000 good, well-paid jobs, with the majority (67%) outside London and the Southeast.

Defence secretary Healey, said:

""Our defence sector should be an engine for jobs and growth, strengthening our security and economy. That requires a defence industry that is better and more integrated - one that can keep our Armed Forces equipped, innovating at a wartime pace, and ahead of our adversaries.

""We will develop this new Defence Industrial Strategy with industry, with innovators and with workers. We will mobilise the private sector to help face down global threats, direct more public investment to British businesses and create jobs and growth in every nation and region of the UK.

""National security is the foundation for national stability and growth. We are sending a signal to the market and to our adversaries: with a strong UK defence sector we will make Britain secure at home and strong abroad.""

The new strategy will be shaped with the defence industry, identifying opportunities to innovate at speed, with the resilience to deter aggression by adversaries, able to seize the opportunity presented by the technologies of the future, while growing the UK's share of the exports market.

Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, said:

""The government underlining the importance of the defence sector to the UK economy is hugely welcomed, particularly the sector's inclusion as a high priority area for growth. ADS has consistently convened meaningful engagement between our members, MOD and wider stakeholders, and we look forward to continuing this in the latest phase. Industry greatly appreciates the opportunity for deep involvement with these processes. To deliver the right capability to support the UK's ability to deter, it is pivotal that we continue to contribute to military planning activities.""

The government is also appointing a fully-fledged National Armaments director. It aims to ensure the armed forces are properly equipped to defend Britain, to build up the British defence industry and to crack down on waste.

The government's primary mission is to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 - with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country - and with more than 200,000 UK jobs supported through spend with the defence industry, the new strategy will have a key role to play in this.

The strategy was a manifesto pledge and is expected to be published in the first half of 2025. The government has committed to spending 2.5 percent of GDP on defence and will set a clear path in the Spring.

Under this government, there has been renewed confidence in the UK defence industry, including Rheinmetall committing a new factory which will see the UK manufacture artillery gun barrels for the first time in ten years, using British steel produced by Sheffield Forgemasters.

The last Defence Industrial Strategy was published in 2021, before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The new Defence Industrial Strategy will align with the Strategic Defence Review.

The Defence Industrial Strategy is commissioned by the Defence Secretary and will be the sector plan for defence in government's wider industrial strategy. The ministry of defence and the department for business and trade will work to ensure the Defence Industrial Strategy and upcoming trade strategy is complimentary."
UK manufacturing PMI sinks to 9-month low as orders dry up,Cyprus Mail,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/12/07/uk-manufacturing-pmi-sinks-to-9-month-low-as-orders-dry-up/,"A gauge of British manufacturing activity pointed to the sharpest contraction in nine months, as orders from domestic and foreign customers fell and ongoing supply chain disruption pushed up costs.

The S&P Global manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index sank to 48.0 in November from 49.9 in October - below an earlier estimate of 48.6 and the 50 level that divides growth from contraction.

S&P cited headwinds from a 25 billion pound ($32 billion) rise in employment taxes in the new Labour government's Oct. 30 budget, a 7 per cent increase in Britain's minimum wage, disruption to shipping in the Red Sea and the threat of global goods tariffs.

""Manufacturers are left facing an environment of high costs, low demand and raised uncertainty for the foreseeable future,"" S&P director Rob Dobson said.

""While companies of all sizes are experiencing a downturn, small companies are the hardest hit, reporting especially marked drops in output, new orders and new export business,"" he added.

Last week US President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all goods the United States imports from Canada and Mexico and he has floated blanket tariffs of 10 per cent to 20 per cent on virtually all imports.

Some businesses said clients were delaying or cancelling investment projects due to increased costs following the budget and broader global uncertainty, S&P said.

Orders, output and employment all fell at the fastest pace in nine months.

Official data showed British manufacturing output volumes in September were 0.7 per cent lower than their level a year earlier."
Fields on Wheels casts eyes on food supply chain links,Winnipeg Free Press,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/2024/12/06/fields-on-wheels-casts-eyes-on-food-supply-chain-links,"I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.

Long before the words ""supply chain disruption"" became common parlance, Barry Prentice, a professor at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba, helped create its department of supply chain management.

Known for, among other things, his enthusiasm for the potential airships could have in opening up the movement of goods in the North, Prentice also organizes the annual Fields on Wheels conference that invites experts to focus on issue of agribusiness logistics.

This year's (virtual) 29th conference focuses on food prices -- an issue so important it may have decided the recent U.S. presidential election.

With experts like Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, who will provide an assessment of trends in food prices and some issues resulting from a second Trump administration that could affect Canada, the conference will bring together a wide range of interests connected by agricultural supply chains.

Canada enjoys a natural advantage in the production of agricultural goods to trade on world markets.

In an open trading economy, the impacts of global events find their way home to the grocery store as much as to the farmstead.

Closer to home, there are also issues surrounding food security and food costs in the North that will be discussed at the free conference Wednesday. (Registration is open to the public at eventbrite.ca.)

Volker Kromm, executive director of the Thunder Bay-based Regional Food Distribution Association, will speak on increasing demand for food assistance and efforts in northwest Ontario to build food distribution capacity.

Kromm has been working with many in the region to try to develop a network so remote communities can operate something similar to urban food banks.

A while ago, folks from Pikangikum (about 100 kilometres north of Red Lake, Ont.) reached out to Kromm, asking why can't they have access to food from the RFDA.

""I said, we just have to figure out how to get it to them,"" Kromm said in an interview. ""But the problem was, when we sent food to Pikangikum, there was no place to put it.""

Kromm is working in tandem with First Nations in the region that are putting together a bulk-buying group.

Adding to the high cost of transporting food to remote locations is the logistics of storage and distribution. Kromm said he's made the mistake of shipping food stuffs to communities that had no capacity to handle it, resulting in waste.

He is in the process of building a $60-million expansion to facilities in Thunder Bay and a satellite warehouse in Ignace, 250 kilometres northwest.

""It's my pilot project and about six more communities who say they want to get in on it,"" he said.

""The idea is to have a few storage sites so that we could distribute food, whether it be charitable food or purchased bulk food.""

While the cost of getting food to the North is not coming down, Kromm said there is more funding available for capacity-building.

Meantime, Prentice has often noted a huge chunk of food inflation is a function of the supply chain.

""Something like an average of about 90 per cent of all the cost of food occurs beyond the farm,"" the U of M researcher said.

""I like to tell my students the cap on a bottle of beer is worth more than the barley (inside).""

Prentice believes while the rise in the cost of food has been dramatic -- maybe more so recently than in the previous 29 years -- it's just another impact of increased interest rates, energy costs and rising wages.

""It all adds to the supply chain expenses that have helped create the rise in food prices,"" he said."
"Containing US, EU, and UK sanctions risks in a time of global crisis",nortonrosefulbright.com,https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/knowledge/publications/0c7bd634/containing-us-eu-and-uk-sanctions-risks-in-a-time-of-global-crisis,"The main regulator of US sanctions programs is the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC""). The US Department of State collaborates with OFAC, is a key player in policy guidance, including licensing decisions, and has a primary role with respect to secondary sanctions. In addition, the US Department of Commerce administers often parallel export controls on US-origin goods, services, and technology. While OFAC issues civil penalties for sanctions violations, criminal penalties are handled by the US Department of Justice.

The pandemic has magnified the challenges of complying with sanctions laws, as companies are operating in a stressful and uncertain economic environment, and resources that otherwise would be directed to sanctions compliance may be strained. Meanwhile, the pace of regulatory and investigative activity shows no signs of slowdown.

A. New internal and external threats

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, companies with international business have had to confront significant business pressures due to supply chain disruption, quarantines and travel restrictions, and other barriers to cross-border trade and transactions. These constraints can make companies more vulnerable to sanctioned parties and other bad actors, or more likely to engage in higher risk transactions, such as transactions with customers or third parties that have close ties to sanctioned parties or corrupt government officials, or have questionable sources of wealth or payments. For example, a company whose supplier has had to shut down its factories and who urgently needs to source goods to fill an order might fast-track an alternative supplier through its vetting process and inadvertently miss that it is, say, owned or controlled by an EU asset freeze target. Even if that entity is not on the EU consolidated list, it would be considered to be sanctioned and the company's transactions with that entity would be prohibited (if it is an EU company or potentially if there another EU nexus to the business). As another example, a company that has lost significant business as a result of COVID-19 may not apply the same level of scrutiny to payments, customers, or third parties that it ordinarily would, and might miss that a customer is a shell company owned by a Russian oligarch who has been designated as an SDN (meaning if there is a US company or there is a US nexus to the transaction, the transaction is prohibited, or even where there is no US nexus, the transaction could result in SDN designation risk or secondary sanctions risk) or that payments are derived from illegitimate sources. Further, in these circumstances, companies may not have the resources or capability to properly consider the details and nuances of particular sanctions restrictions, or the wording of a particular license or guidance from a sanctions authority, resulting in a lack of understanding of their actual legal risk. Companies should, therefore, be mindful of potential vulnerabilities presented by the current crisis, and take appropriate steps to avoid compliance pitfalls.

The new remote working environment has created some benefits, but also can complicate compliance efforts. It can make it more difficult to monitor suspicious activity and ongoing risks, and therefore harder to detect and prevent potential violations. Internal controls, including approval processes and reporting mechanisms, designed to identify or thwart unlawful activity also may be disrupted because the responsible personnel or systems are unavailable or less accessible. With more employees working remotely, there are also a greater number of potential threats internally as organizations are navigating new barriers to connectivity and becoming more decentralized, which might make it more difficult for the tone from the top to get disseminated widely or to maintain a unified culture of compliance. Many companies also have had to contend with logistical difficulties conducting audits, internal investigations, trainings, and site visits for data collection. For example, the nuances of body language may get lost when conducting an interview via a virtual platform, it may be difficult to evaluate audience participation in a virtual training, or it may not be possible to travel abroad to collect documents for an investigation. While companies are increasingly reopening, if some measure of distancing and remote working continues for the near future, some of these staffing, resource, and logistical challenges to compliance may remain.

B. Potential for increased investigations and enforcement

Despite increased vulnerabilities during the pandemic, there are no signs that enforcement authorities are easing their sanctions compliance expectations. Given the potential for increased bad conduct during times of economic crisis, one can expect a corollary increase in government investigations and enforcement following an economic downturn. Furthermore, in more recent years, sanctions have been more aggressively enforced and are increasingly being wielded as a tool to advance national security and foreign policy interests. In addition, regulators within the US (both at the federal and state levels) and worldwide are coordinating more frequently, and, in the US, sanctions investigations are more often overlapping with investigations relating to anti-money laundering, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Export Administration Regulations, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. For example, the criminal charges that were announced on April 20, 2020 against Industrial Bank of Korea (""IBK"") following coordinated state and federal efforts involve alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and deficiencies in its anti-money laundering program at IBK's New York branch, which allegedly permitted the processing of more than $1 billion in transactions in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Companies should keep in mind, therefore, that their international trade and transactions could be subject to scrutiny from multiple regulators in addition to sanctions authorities, and misconduct involving one area of the law or one jurisdiction, can spiral into cross-border or interagency investigations.

C. Recent regulatory and legislative developments

Since March 13, 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, OFAC has had a steady stream of new designations and other actions, both related and unrelated to COVID-19. These actions are not all detailed here, but key developments related to COVID-19 include (1) OFAC's issuance on March 6, 2020 of a Frequently Asked Question (#828) related to humanitarian assistance with regard to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran; (2) the Treasury Department's issuance of a press release on April 9, 2020 underscoring its commitment to the global flow of humanitarian aid in the face of COVID-19; (3) OFAC's publication on April 16, 2020 of a fact-sheet on the provision of humanitarian assistance and trade to combat COVID-19; (4) OFAC's issuance of guidance on April 20, 2020 encouraging persons to communicate OFAC compliance concerns related to COVID-19; and (5) OFAC's issuance on June 5, 2020 of a Frequently Asked Question (#830) stating that OFAC is not targeting Iranian manufacturers of medicines, medical devices, or products used for sanitation or hygiene or as personal protective equipment for use in Iran pursuant to Executive Order 13902 for continuing to manufacture these items.

While OFAC has acknowledged that companies are shifting resources away from sanctions compliance programs and it would evaluate these issues on a case-by-case basis, companies should understand that this flexibility is not unconditional. In its guidance dated April 20, 2020, OFAC stated:

""If a business facing technical and resource challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic chooses, as part of its risk-based approach to sanctions compliance, to account for such challenges by temporarily reallocating sanctions compliance resources consistent with that approach, OFAC will evaluate this as a factor in determining the appropriate administrative response to an apparent violation that occurs during this period.""

Importantly, OFAC indicated that a company's decision to reallocate its resources to other areas needs to be consistent with its risk-based approach to sanctions compliance and this reallocation must be caused by the pandemic and temporary. In addition, OFAC's guidance encourages businesses affected by COVID-19 to contact OFAC as soon as practicable if they believe they may experience delays in their ability to meet OFAC's deadlines, including requirements related to filing blocking and reject reports within ten (10) business days, responses to administrative subpoenas, reports required by general or specific licenses, or any other required reports or submissions. Far from providing a carte blanche to companies, therefore, OFAC's announcement signals that its compliance expectations have not eased and if companies are facing pandemic-related challenges, OFAC is willing to consider those as a mitigating factor in its assessment of the appropriate administrative response. However, companies must be prepared to show that their reassignment of compliance resources was part of a risk-based approach to sanctions compliance. Companies should, therefore, carefully consider how they are allocating their compliance resources and ensure that any decisions to shift resources away from sanctions compliance are reasonably commensurate with their risk profile and carefully documented.

Those engaged in the international flow of humanitarian aid also should keep in mind that while OFAC has emphasized its commitment to such aid to areas affected by COVID-19, OFAC has not, to date, expanded upon its existing and longstanding humanitarian exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations. OFAC's fact sheet dated April 16, 2020 highlights the most relevant exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations for humanitarian assistance and trade under the Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Ukraine/Russia-related sanctions programs. The fact sheet also provides specific guidance for OFAC-administered sanctions programs related to personal protective equipment, such as face shields and masks, gloves, clothing, and certain respirators and ventilators, and other COVID-19-related humanitarian assistance and trade. For transactions not otherwise covered by the existing exemptions, exceptions, and authorizations, OFAC notes that license requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and it will prioritize applications, compliance questions, and other requests related to humanitarian support, in relation to the people of these countries.

Further, as the Treasury Department has cautioned, such humanitarian assistance has the potential to be misused and/or diverted by bad actors. In its April 9, 2020 press release, the Treasury Department stated that ""[w]hile the vast majority of US-based non-profit organizations are at low risk for terrorist financing, humanitarian organizations delivering assistance to conflict regions face a potentially higher risk of aid diversion in support of terrorist financing, corruption, or other illicit purposes."" OFAC also has advised organizations seeking to provide humanitarian assistance to sanctioned countries impacted by the virus to implement reasonable, risk-based compliance measures, including due diligence, governance, transparency, accountability, and other such measures. Therefore, although OFAC has articulated its support for humanitarian aid to virus-affected areas, including sanctioned countries, it has warned companies to be wary of bad actors seeking to exploit these authorizations.

On the legislative front, several bills have been introduced following the virus outbreak, authorizing the imposition of sanctions for certain pandemic-related misconduct. For example, certain bills would impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in deliberate acts to conceal or distort information COVID-19, and would specifically target certain Chinese officials and entities.

There also have been several EU sanctions-related developments relating to COVID-19, including the following:

These recent developments, along with others unrelated to COVID-19, such as OFAC's recent issuance of maritime advisory guidance (covered in our separate briefing here), indicate that the US and EU remain committed to actively administering and enforcing sanctions laws during the pandemic, and companies need to be vigilant about ongoing and emergent sanctions risks."
Schumer visits Little Falls to push for dairy farmer support,CNYhomepage,https://www.cnyhomepage.com/news/local-news/schumer-visits-little-falls-to-push-for-dairy-farmer-support/,"LITTLE FALLS, NY (WUTR/WFXV/WPNY) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was in Little Falls on Friday, December 3 to push for senators to avoid a ""dairy cliff.""

Standing at the Casler Family Farm in Little Falls, Schumer revealed that the Dairy Margin Coverage Program (DMC) is set to expire at the end of the month. Schumer said that if the country goes over the ""dairy cliff,"" Herkimer County's 85 dairy farms could lose out on much-needed support and cause massive disruptions in the supply chain.

The DMC is a risk-management tool that offers protection to dairy farmers. The tool is used when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed price -- also known as the ""margin"" -- falls below a certain amount selected by the producer. Schumer said that if the DMC is allowed to expire, dairy farmers would lose out on monthly payments provided by the program. That in turn could cause a massive supply chain disruption that could reduce access to -- and increase the price of -- dairy products.

""Dairy is the lifeblood of Herkimer County agriculture with over 10,000 dairy cows producing over 70% of the county's agricultural sales dollars. But by the end of this year many of our Mohawk Valley dairy farms could be looking over a 'dairy cliff' that threatens lifeline payments, puts the industry in limbo, and increases the price of milk,"" Senator Schumer said in a statement. ""The Dairy Margin Coverage Program is essential to support our farmers, like Casler Family Farm, and to keep the best quality milk made from New York farms flowing to families across America. I helped enact the Dairy Margin Coverage Program in the 2018 Farm Bill and it is imperative we extend it before it expires at the end of this year. I will not stop fighting to ensure this critical program and safety net for our Upstate dairy farmers is protected.""

Casler Family Farm alone produces approximately 120,000 gallons of milk from its approximately 110 cows annually. In the last three to four years, the farm has received approximately $20,000 from the DMC.

In all, Herkimer County produced almost $66 million in dairy sales among its 85 farms, making it the 22nd-biggest dairy-producing county in New York, according to the Department of Agriculture. That accounts for over 70 percent of the county's agricultural sales every year.

In comparison, Oneida County's 138 dairy farms make it the 14th-biggest county.

New York State is also one of the largest dairy states in the nation, producing over 16 billion pounds of milk annually among its approximately 3,000 farms. That makes New York the fifth-largest dairy state in the United States.

""The dairy industry is a vital part of the economy here in New York State. Dairy farms provide jobs and revenue within our rural communities which helps support our schools and other businesses throughout the state. DMC has been a critical program over the last decade to sustain dairy producers through times of low milk prices and high feed costs,"" USDA FSA New York State Executive Director Jim Barber said in a statement. ""I want to sincerely thank Senator Schumer for his long-standing support of the DMC program and his push to get it extended for 2024 and hopefully, again for 2025.""

However, if Congress doesn't reauthorize the Farm Bill -- which received a one-year extension last September -- farmers could see detrimental impacts begin almost immediately.

Should the Farm Bill be allowed to lapse, the country would be required to purchase milk at a price that would cost them billions of dollars in spending, which Schumer said could be passed on to the customer. Consumers may see fewer options for milk in stores, while products like baby formula, protein powder and other dairy products may see limited availability.

""Herkimer County is at the heart of Upstate New York's dairy industry, and the looming ""Dairy Cliff"" threatens an essential safety net for our dairy farmers. Going over the Dairy Cliff would add more risk and uncertainty into dairy markets, disrupt supply chains, increase milk prices at grocery stores, and more. With most of Herkimer County's agricultural sales driven by dairy farms, renewal of the Dairy Margin Coverage Program is absolutely critical to maintaining the stable dairy markets that the countless rural, farm-driven communities across our region depend on,"" Little Falls Town Supervisor and Casler Family Farm Owner Daniel Casler said in a statement. ""On behalf of dairy farmers in Herkimer County and across New York State, I would like to extend our collective appreciation to Senator Schumer for fighting to reauthorize the Dairy Margin Coverage program and protect our state's dairy farms. I've heard it said before that the greatest function of Government is to do for the tax-paying citizenry what they cannot ordinarily do for themselves. I commend Senator Schumer for continuing to carry the torch in pursuit of that function - and for doing so here at my farm, in support of dairy farmers like me."""
"Supply chain execs wary of three trends in 2025, Moody's says",DC Velocity,https://www.dcvelocity.com/supply-chain-execs-wary-of-three-trends-in-2025-moodys-says,"Leaders are watching for impacts of rising tariffs, corporate transparency, and supplier risk assessments.

Three issues ranking at top of mind for supply chain executives in 2025 will be supply chain restrictions, reputational risk, and quantifying risk exposure, according to Moody's, a global integrated risk assessment firm.

Each of those points could have a stark impact on business operations, the firm said. First, supply chain restrictions will continue to drive up costs, following examples like European tariffs on Chinese autos and the U.S. plan to prevent Chinese software and hardware from entering cars in America.

Second, reputational risk will peak due to increased corporate transparency and due diligence laws, such as Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act that addresses hotpoint issues like modern slavery, forced labor, human trafficking, and environmental damage. In an age when polarized public opinion is combined with ever-present social media, doing business with a supplier whom a lot of your customers view negatively will be hard to navigate.

And third, advances in data, technology, and supplier risk assessments will enable executives to measure the impact of disruptions more effectively. Those calculations can help organizations determine whether their risk mitigation strategies represent value for money when compared to the potential revenues losses in the event of a supply chain disruption.

""Looking past the holidays, retailers will need to prepare for the typical challenges posed by seasonal slowdown in consumer demand. This year, however, there will be much less of a lull, as U.S. companies are accelerating some purchases that could potentially be impacted by a new wave of tariffs on U.S. imports,"" Andrei Quinn-Barabanov, Senior Director - Supplier Risk Management Solutions at Moody's, said in a release. ""Tariffs, sanctions and other supply chain restrictions will likely be top of the 2025 agenda for procurement executives."""
"Leveraging Sustainability Data, AI-Powered Software to Create Business Value",WSJ,https://deloitte.wsj.com/sustainable-business/leveraging-sustainability-data-ai-powered-software-to-create-business-value-fcfbeceb,"Salesforce sustainability and business leaders discuss how organizations can integrate data management efforts with strategy to do much more than meet regulatory requirements

Data collection and reporting processes focusing on sustainability are often driven by voluntary reporting or regulatory requirements, but sustainability data can be deployed to enhance market value and benefit the entire enterprise.

Many companies are in the early stages of their sustainability data management journey. As organizations develop sustainability data management systems focused on what data they need for reporting and compliance purposes and where they can locate it, they can also integrate that data into strategic planning and innovation, says Mike Danitz, a principal in the Finance and Enterprise Performance practice with Deloitte Consulting LLP, during a recent webcast, Sustainability and Data Management: Unleashing the Value Beyond Reporting.

""Although there are challenges in collecting and processing data from disparate data sources, AI-enhanced sustainability software and platforms offer compelling potential for enhancing sustainability data management, particularly in improving data accuracy, predictive analytics, data collection, and real-time environmental monitoring,"" Danitz says. As reporting shifts from voluntary to mandatory under requirements such as the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD),1 many companies are faced with a challenge of applying rigor to their nonfinancial metrics as they have historically with financial data.

Danitz discussed the challenges and possibilities of developing sustainability data management capabilities with Emma Grande, director of ESG Strategy and Engagement at Salesforce; Brian Komar, vice president of Sustainability Customer Programs at Salesforce; Paul Ziemba, technology lead for Salesforce Sustainability solutions at Deloitte Consulting, LLP; and Luis Galito, a principal and Salesforce Sustainability Offerings lead with Deloitte Consulting LLP.

Danitz: How can companies recognize more value from their sustainability data beyond reporting compliance?

Ziemba: Sustainability data can help companies increase revenue, reduce costs, and mitigate risks. In terms of revenue growth, we see indicators in the market that consumers prefer ethically sourced products and services like fair-trade coffee, renewable energy, and electric vehicles, which can command price premiums and increase customer loyalty. As carbon pricing evolves globally, reductions in carbon emissions can also provide value through offsets and credits.

As for cost efficiency, sustainability data can help organizations improve operational practices, and transparency about sustainability efforts may result in lower capital costs. It can also help organizations retain talent as many workers are increasingly focused on corporate sustainability performance. To help mitigate risks, sustainability data can be used to reduce supply chain disruption, maintain supply availability, and protect the organization from penalties and taxes associated with noncompliance as well as protecting brand reputation by helping prevent the appearance of greenwashing.

Komar: Focusing on the value that comes from sustainability data is critical. We have seen many examples of multinational and Fortune 500 companies that are increasing their asset efficiency, reducing emissions intensity, and reducing costs in ways that are improving the bottom line. We see organizations identifying opportunities for new products and services driving growth that are particularly compelling. The main challenge is enabling C-suite leaders across enterprises to leverage the data for innovation to unlock opportunity.

What are some of the challenges in enabling more effective sustainability data management, and how can they be mitigated?

Ziemba: The main challenge companies face is accessing reliable, detailed data. They often struggle with either no access or data that's hard to interpret because it comes from spreadsheets, manual processes, or inconsistent views. Many companies are focusing on assessing their current data and finding ways to make it more detailed, repeatable, or harmonized on a platform or through a process.

Komar: Companies can start by considering the various standards and frameworks they aim to meet. For example, CSRD requires more than 1,100 data points covering not only environmental issues but also social and governance issues. A platform approach can help companies report to several difficult requirements, enabling companies to input the data once and then report to multiple destinations.

How can AI help organizations meet the data management challenges?

Grande: It's common for organizations to begin with predictive analytics for setting long-term objectives. For example, if a company aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, part of that strategy might include looking at business travel and setting goals to reduce the total number of flights. Using predictive analytics helps project future travel trends, enabling a decrease in travel emissions under Scope 3. In other use cases, depending on the industry, AI can also help with real-time environmental data. For instance, it can enhance monitoring of weather, water usage, or energy consumption.

By combining predictive analytics and real-time data capabilities, businesses can not only set ambitious sustainability goals but also take informed actions to achieve them. At Salesforce, for example, we've created an AI agent to support our sustainability team, which surfaces key insights from our sustainability data, helping to optimize the collection, analysis, and sharing of information with stakeholders.

What are some possible use cases for generative AI in this respect?

Galito: AI has demonstrated its ability to automate routine tasks, provide personalized insights and recommendations, and enhance decision-making through rapid data aggregation and advanced predictive analytics. AI can also improve the streamlining of risk management and compliance by detecting fraud and data anomalies, aiding in regulatory compliance and report preparation.

For sustainability specifically, generative AI can drive improvements in sustainability data performance management by automating data validation, report configuration, and cross-functional outreach activities. It can help reduce noncompliance penalties by identifying emerging regulatory requirements and configuring report templates accordingly, and it supports data fidelity in sustainability data management platforms.

For Scope 3 emissions, generative AI can be used to improve inventory accuracy by automating engagement and follow-up with the supply chain to ensure complete and accurate data submission. Additionally, it can forecast KPI progression and risks, proactively influencing sustainability trajectories through advanced predictive insights.

Grande: Generative AI can bring efficiencies to sustainability reporting. Where organizations are still dependent on manual, labor-intensive processes for voluntary reporting, these processes are likely not scalable given the increasing statutory requirements from multiple countries. Generative AI can help streamline and automate these processes, making them faster, smarter, and more consistent.

What are your suggestions for senior leaders who want to improve their sustainability data management practices?

Ziemba: A platform approach that can be scaled and adapted as an organization's needs change and regulations evolve is an important starting point. Adopting practices to promote data accuracy and quality is paramount as expectations grow for data to be auditable and traceable. The use of analytics and visualizations is also important for deriving value, enabling people to forecast emissions, explore scenarios, and track progress efficiently. Change management is also important for enabling adoption of data management approaches to identify, understand, and meet the needs of stakeholders.

Komar: Leaders should focus on the culture or the conditions that are in place to enable transformation leveraging good practices. For example, a cross-functional leadership group that includes finance, sustainability, and technology teams can work together collaboratively to enable transformation. Leaders can focus on establishing a data tooling effort to manage the vast and diverse types of immature and unstructured data that needs to be managed.

This process often takes longer than anticipated and is crucial for meeting regulatory and compliance timelines. Investment in talent is also critical for enabling transformation. Upskilling and training the workforce to enable new capabilities in data management is essential.

Galito: Set the tone from the top. Leaders can highlight the importance of sustainability and promote understanding of its significance. This involves integrating sustainable practices into the entire enterprise and educating people on how these efforts affect business units. By doing this, organizations can align on common sustainability goals and make investments in technology and data that are future-proof and scalable.

Grande: Build internal alignments. Leaders may not be accustomed to discussing topics like human capital externally, but they can break through silos and share sustainability data insights with both executives and frontline employees to help shape the narrative and prepare for external communication.

Increase in Aniline prices in the USA during November 2024,chemanalyst.com,https://www.chemanalyst.com/NewsAndDeals/NewsDetails/increase-in-aniline-prices-in-the-usa-during-november-2024-31980,"In November 2024, the North American Aniline market experienced a bullish trend, driven by steady consumption and constrained supply availability. The market faced supply constraints, which were exacerbated by disruptions in production and logistics, leading to a tightening of inventory levels.

In the first half of the month, the Aniline production rates were intermediate in the producing country, supported by moderate feedstock availability. At the same time, supply levels from China, a key Aniline exporting market, were slightly reduced due to ongoing disruptions in container shipping services in the East China Sea. Port congestion and vessel delays caused by Typhoon Kong-Rey, which struck Taiwan and moved northward, affected eastern China and Japan, further complicating supply chains.

The Aniline offtakes stayed consistent in the pharmaceutical industry. The Pharmaceutical sector showed signs of recovery, driven by multiple FDA approvals that helped companies like Gilead Sciences and Bristol Myers Squibb rebound from previous market capitalization declines. US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts enabled industry leaders to advance R&D pipelines and form billion-dollar strategic alliances, buffering the impact of upcoming patent cliffs. Meanwhile, the generics business grew across all regions, with a 30% increase in the U.S. Meanwhile, the order for Aniline remained moderate from Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate manufacturers, influenced by varied consumption of isocyanates in the Polyurethane sector. The demand for polyurethane materials remained strong in the automotive industry. In October, an increment of 12.8% from a month ago and a 9.6% increase from a year ago, as given by the preliminary figures, including the estimates for the GM/Stellantis/Tesla and other sales figures. However, the consumption of polyurethane materials was slow in the construction industry. In October 2024, the U.S. construction sector faced ongoing labor and material shortages, delaying projects and straining cash flows. Despite a 4.6% year-on-year increase in construction spending for September, growth was hindered by delays. Private and public construction saw modest month-on-month gains, with notable investments in highways and education.

Meanwhile, in the second half of November, Aniline prices were briefly impacted by rising inventory levels in China, a key producer and exporter. This decline was driven by ongoing weak demand in the country and increased production following the restart of the Tianji Aniline plant, which negatively influenced the prices, and exporters reduced their quotations. However, supply chain disruption and steady demand from domestic buyers positively influenced the Aniline prices towards the end of the month. Conclusively, at the end of November 2024, Aniline CFR Texas prices hovered at USD 1380/MT after witnessing a 3.7% increase in last month's prices."
3 Reasons Why I Bought Celsius Stock | The Motley Fool,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/06/3-reasons-why-i-bought-celsius-stock/,"After weeks of pondering the decision, I finally made a move into Celsius Holdings (CELH -3.73%). Shares of the energy drink maker made massive gains under the leadership of CEO John Fieldly, highlighting his abilities to develop a following in the fitness community and score a lucrative distribution agreement with multinational behemoth PepsiCo.

Nonetheless, the beverage stock has pulled back significantly this year. It is in this environment that I bought Celsius shares, and three reasons explain why.

As mentioned, part of Celsius's competitive advantage came from its rising popularity among fitness enthusiasts. Unlike competitors, such as Red Bull and Monster, Celsius emphasizes natural ingredients such as green tea extract and ginger root. It also derives its caffeine source from guarana seeds, which have more than twice the caffeine of coffee beans. This approach has made it the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S.

Despite improving sales prospects for nature-based products, Celsius stock has fallen more than 70% from its high amid an inventory glut. A major Celsius distributor, likely PepsiCo, lowered its purchases to reduce inventory.

Consequently, in the third quarter of 2024, revenue dropped 31% from year-ago levels. So important was this drop that its revenue for the first nine months of 2024 totaled $1 billion. That's an increase of just 5% compared to the same period in 2023, and far below the 104% yearly growth rate in the first three quarters of 2023.

Moreover, net income for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to $131 million, 7% less than 12 months ago. That occurred amid a 31% increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The effect was particularly severe in the third quarter, as the most recent quarter earned Celsius only $1.5 million in net income.

However, Fieldly also stated in the Q3 earnings report that the supply chain optimization challenges with its largest distributor have ""largely stabilized."" While shareholders should still pay attention to that issue, signs of growth returning should help the stock.

An increase in international sales could boost revenue even more. Non-North America sales were only 5% of revenue in the first three quarters of 2024. That was up from 4% during the same timeframe in 2023, as its non-North American revenue rose 37% during the same period. This means the international market is largely untapped, pointing to the potential for more revenue growth longer-term.

The current challenges mean that investors can buy Celsius stock at a significant discount. Due to the stock's sharp pullback of over 70%, investors can buy shares at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that may sound high, this is far below the average 69 earnings multiple over the last year and represents an attractive level if the stabilized supply chain helps lead to a return of sales growth.

The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio appears to confirm this thesis. The current sales multiple of 4.9 is far below the 9.6 average over the last year and the 14 average in the last five years. This implies a massive discount for a stock that is more than likely experiencing a temporary growth setback.

Considering the current state of Celsius stock, I believe I bought it on a likely overreaction to the supply chain disruption. Indeed, less purchasing from its largest distributor is concerning. Nonetheless, that is likely a temporary setback, and its small but fast-growing international segment bodes well for its future in the long term.

Moreover, growing emphasis on natural products should help highlight its competitive advantage. When also considering the heavily discounted stock price and valuation metrics, buying Celsius stock was an easy decision."
Mitratech: A Conversation With GRC Solutions Executive Director Alastair Parr On Driving Technology Innovation,Pulse 2.0,https://pulse2.com/mitratech-profile-alastair-parr-interview/,"Mitratech is a global technology leader empowering corporate legal, risk and compliance, and HR professionals to maximize productivity, control expense, and mitigate risk by deepening operational alignment and increasing collaboration and visibility across their organization. Pulse 2.0 interviewed Mitratech's Executive Director of GRC Solutions, Alastair Parr, to learn more about the company.

Can you tell us about your professional background? Parr said:

""I bring over 15 years of experience in product management, consultancy, and operations. I ensure that customer and market demands are thoughtfully integrated and applied innovatively within the Mitratech solution portfolio. My background is in governance, risk, and compliance, where I've developed and implemented solutions to address the increasingly complex challenges in risk management.""

What are the company's core products and features? Parr explained:

""Mitratech's Governance, Risk and Compliance suite offers end-to-end, top-to-bottom risk and compliance management capabilities, spanning:

Whether organizations are just starting to implement GRC processes or looking to deploy next-generation programs across their full enterprise, Mitratech simplifies the process with cross-industry applications, convenient out-of-the-box templates, and relevant analytics to empower data-driven business outcomes. Mitratech also offers a full suite of Corporate Legal and HR Compliance offerings.""

ESG Monitoring Feature

With ESG compliance becoming a growing priority for regulators and investors, how does Mitratech's new ESG monitoring feature help companies uphold sustainability standards throughout their supply chains? Parr emphasized:

""Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, such as measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have surely emerged as a key priority among companies, investors, and government regulators. Measuring GHG emissions involves focusing on direct emissions and extending attention to indirect emissions throughout the supply chain, where scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions come into play. As more governments legislate ESG and sustainability regulations, companies must sift through mountains of ESG reporting data to meet supply chain compliance requirements.

The Mitratech solution includes new capabilities that enhance ESG and sustainability monitoring and correlate with the results of questionnaire-based ESG risk assessments to standardize and simplify global ESG compliance reporting across your supply chain.

The latest release includes:

-- Globally sourced, standards-based data from a recognized leader in ESG and sustainability reporting.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news, and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

-- A comprehensive library of global sustainability questionnaires with built-in remediation guidance to benchmark reporting.

-- A centralized risk register of assessment results and sustainability data for investigation, triage, and task and event management.

By comprehensively understanding and managing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, companies can mitigate supply chain and reputational risks, meet stakeholder expectations, improve operational efficiency, and gain a competitive edge.""

Designing New Risk Management Tools

In light of this year's high-profile supply chain incidents, what insights did Mitratech apply in designing these new risk management tools? Parr replied:

""Our annual TPRM study showed that 61% of companies reported a third-party breach in 2023 - up nearly 50% in the last year and 3x since 2021. Due to growing supplier populations (often global), organizations are often unable to consistently visualize where their data goes and where proprietary or sensitive data can easily be shared with suppliers and subcontractors. What's more, third-party breaches are among the most expensive for organizations to recover from. Data from the 2024 IBM/Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach Report shows that third-party breaches are the third highest predictor of increased breach costs, increasing costs by 5% above the average.

The latest enhancements are meant to address growing supplier complexity by:

-- Quickly identifying vendors potentially at risk of a software supply chain disruption, reducing risk and speeding up the resolution process.

-- Reducing the time required to analyze the impact of supply chain events.

-- Improving supply chain risk visibility and saving time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence and controversies fully aligned with other enterprise risks.

-- Reducing the time required to populate new assessments, speeding risk analysis and remediation.""

Insights About ESG Scores For Suppliers

Sustainability and ESG have emerged as essential metrics for evaluating vendor relationships. Could you provide insights into the specific ESG criteria Mitratech's platform leverages to assess and score suppliers? Parr noted:

""The Mitratech solution provides insights into several ESG metrics.

-- Globally sourced, standards-based data from a recognized leader in ESG and sustainability reporting.

-- Advanced sustainability ratings and scores, including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and equivalent value in cash (EVIC) intensity, for each supplier to compare over time and against industry averages.

-- Analyst-curated emissions scores, negative news and controversies to deliver visibility on potential reputational concerns.

Data is presented over time, and with it users can compare suppliers against:

With the solution, procurement and supply chain teams can improve supply chain visibility and consistency and save time by providing one-stop access to thousands of ESG scores, intelligence, and controversies, fully aligned with other enterprise risks.""

Evolution Of Mitratech's Technology

How has the company's technology evolved since launching? Parr replied:

""We first introduced our ESG capabilities in 2020 and have since added deeper Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions tracking, overall ESG score enrichment, and ESG controversy tracking to our library of ESG questionnaires, enabling organizations to keep pace with the ever-changing ESG regulatory landscape. As supply chains grow and become more complex, it's essential that organizations centrally track all of their supply chain risks - from cyber disruptions to operational, ESG, and reputational challenges. Our view is that our solution should become the single source of truth for all third-party vendor and supplier risks, which feeds into the overall GRC solution to manage enterprise risks.""

Significant Milestones

What have been some of the company's most significant milestones? Parr cited:

This convergence calls for collaborative solutions that empower teams to manage risk and drive real-time resilience across disciplines. While AI is not new to Mitratech, what's new is how we're connecting it with the industry's largest compliance ecosystem, driving smarter automation, faster results, and increased transparency -- all while leading with accuracy, ethics, and a unified customer experience.'"""
2025 - A look ahead to the year in retail tech,Chain Store Age,https://chainstoreage.com/2025-look-ahead-year-retail-tech,"The Target Store Companion AI-based mobile associate tool (Image: Target).

A new year brings new developments in retail technology.

As 2025 approaches, it's time to dust off the crystal ball and gaze into the trends that will drive the retail technology industry over the next 12 months. Here is a look at how supply chain disruption, AI ""co-piloting,"" and automated delivery will impact the industry:

Supply chain disruption

The global supply chain has recovered from the peak disruption levels of 2020 and 2021 and continues on an uneven course of improvement, but it still does not function as smoothly as it did pre-2020.

The supply chain also remains prone to shocks from ongoing global instability and climate events, as well as strikes affecting both ports and rail service. The possibility of new tariffs being imposed on imported goods in 2025 also raises uncertainty about how the supply chain will function.

All this will lead retailers to implement solutions that can help them better predict potential disruptions, react when they happen, and generally run their supply chains more smoothly to make the inevitable impact of disruptive events less dramatic.

On the predictive side, expect more retailers to follow in the footsteps of Dick's Sporting Goods, which utilizes Inspectorio sourcing and production technology to obtain seamless connection of traceability data with the rest of its sourcing operations, as well as automate manual processes with AI-equipped features.

[READ MORE: Dick's Sporting Goods centralizes sourcing and production with AI]

The retailer also intends to obtain enhanced visibility into performance and production changes and more easily identify which raw materials are being used across multiple purchase orders.

In terms of smoother supply chain operations, retailers should consider the example of Walmart, which runs high-tech fulfillment centers featuring an automated, high-density storage and retrieval system that streamlines a manual, 12-step process down to five steps. It also offers double the storage capacity and twice the number of customer orders the discounter can fulfill in a day, expanding next- or two-day shipping.

AI as co-pilot

Another trend that will help steer the direction of retail technology in 2025 is the growing realization that AI is not a cure-all and does not make things better on its own. Retailers are increasingly finding that the maximum value of AI is obtained when it serves as a ""co-pilot"" that enhances and expands the capabilities of a human user.

For example, Target Corp. is rolling out a new proprietary generative AI chatbot called Store Companion that will help store associates answer customer inquiries and on-the-job process questions, coach new team members and support store operations management.

The new chatbot will be available as an app on specially equipped handheld employee devices, providing immediate answers to their questions about processes and procedures.

On the customer-facing side, e-commerce marketplace Curated uses an AI consumer co-pilot to connect with customers who are a little bit earlier in their buying journey. This allows them to ask questions, start their educational process, and begin to understand the terminology about products.

""Our AI is trained on over two million conversations that our consumers have had with our experts,"" Peter Ombres, CEO and co-founder of Curated, said in an exclusive interview with Chain Store Age. ""This database of interactions helps make our AI extremely useful in the context of shopping.""

However, Curated has found that most customers reach a point in their buying journey where they have questions that only a human can answer, and they are then transitioned to one of the e-tailer's human experts.

Automated delivery

The volume of deliveries keeps expanding and with it, consumer expectations for packages to arrive potentially within hours or even minutes of placing an order. It's no wonder that retailers continue to look to automated delivery technologies, a trend set to grow in 2025.

Drone technology is one of the most talked-about automated delivery solutions, and now that Amazon has received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permission to fly its Prime Air delivery drones beyond the visual line of sight of the pilot and Walmart is enabling select drone delivery orders directly in its app, other retailers will surely follow.

Some smaller retailers already have, such as quick service restaurant chains Panera Bread and Jet's Pizza recently launching delivery via Zipline drones in select markets.

Sidewalk robots are also a burgeoning automated delivery platform, as evidenced by recent rollouts from entities including Shake Shack, Uber Eats and Grubhub. And as driverless vehicles continue evolving, expect more pilots like Uber Eats' ongoing testing of Waymo robotaxis."
"IMF roots for South Sudan political stability, transparency to counter economic woes - Eye Radio",Eye Radio,https://www.eyeradio.org/imf-roots-for-south-sudan-political-stability-transparency-to-counter-economic-woes/,"The International Monetary Fund said it has noted with concern South Sudan's severe economic and humanitarian challenges, and recommends political stability and policy adjustment on governance and transparency as key to boosting donor confidence.

On November 15, 2024, IMF's Executive Board discussed the Third and Final Review of South Sudan's Staff-Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB), where it underscored that spillovers from the Sudan war have worsened South Sudan's macroeconomic situation and exacerbated an already difficult humanitarian situation.

In a press statement, IMF said it observed the country's severe economic and humanitarian situation, caused by the war in Sudan, flooding, and combined with domestic policy slippages.

It urges the South Sudan government to continue building on the progress made under the Management-endorsed Staff Monitored Program with Board Involvement (PMB) to restore economic stability and maintain debt sustainability.

""Concrete steps to strengthen political stability and address policy missteps and structural challenges, particularly on governance and transparency, would be essential to boost donor confidence,"" it said.

""Noting that program performance has significantly weakened, Directors welcomed the corrective measures taken by the authorities and their commitment to further remedial measures in support of the program's objectives, including efforts to clear salary arrears and prioritize critical social spending.""

The financial agency pointed out that ruptures on a pipeline carrying 70 percent of South Sudan's crude oil through Sudan has led to a sharp decline oil exports, resulting in lower foreign exchange inflows, currency depreciation and sharp fiscal revenue drop leading to the accumulation of salary arrears, and high inflation.

The war in Sudan has also led to a massive influx of over 800,000 people to South Sudan and supply chain disruption as more 7.1 million South Sudanese are estimated to be experiencing acute food insecurity.

IMF said the South Sudanese authorities face the challenging task of meeting higher spending needs, including on humanitarian relief, against the backdrop of limited financing options.

IMF's Board of Directors welcomed gradual depreciation of the official exchange rate to narrow the gap

with the parallel market and underscored the need for further adjustment to unify the Foreign Exchange markets and eliminate distortions.

The agency encouraged efforts to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and preserve financial stability, including by enacting remaining recommendations from the Safeguards Assessment.

It further said it positively noted the improvements in transparency and governance of fiscal and monetary operations and the oil sector and called for sustained efforts in these areas."
Global Electronic Components Distributors: Connecting Innovation Worldwide,TechBullion,https://techbullion.com/global-electronic-components-distributors-connecting-innovation-worldwide/,"Electronic component distributors have assumed an essential role in today's rapidly evolving technology. Such a need arises because as new technologies develop, these distributors give life to ideas and businesses by providing the components needed. This article describes how global electronic components distributors are bolstering rise in innovation, improving the efficiency of supply chains, and fostering technological development.

How Global Electronic Components Distributors Changing Strategies Towards the Delivery of Components

The demand for electronic components varies, but an electronic component distributors distribution model enables a consistent demand-supply symbiosis. Today's electronic components distributor help fill the relatively low supply of technology and complex devices required by various industries from sourcing, waiting in the long supply chains, caring about the quality and especially the technical support of devices to the integration into the systems.

Electronic component distributors cover distances and continents to procure parts and deliver them to their customers in other sectors. These businesses engage in more than simply delivering goods; they also manage stock, ensure quality control, and provide technical assistance so that their clientele can innovate without being concerned about supply chain disruption.

Promoting Creativity and New Ideas

Technological advancement in automotive, healthcare, telecommunications, and consumer electronics industries is the main driving force behind the growing demand for electronic components around the globe. Distribution partners fulfill such demands by ensuring prompt availability of the necessary components for new inventions.

Such reconfiguration in the automobile segment toward electric and autonomous vehicles has created a surge in demand for advanced sensors, processors, and connectivity modules. To meet these requirements, global electronic components distributors have developed strong supply chains in order to provide a specialized variety of components to automotive manufacturers.

Healthcare domain equally tends to experience an increasing demand for medical devices and wearables too. These equipment are dependent on minuscule electronic components which are being distributed for purchasing thanks to the deftness of distributors. As a result of the ability to produce such life-saving devices, distributors of electronic components play a positive role in global health and wellness.

Addressing Supply Chain Issues

The COVID-19 pandemic and the latest geopolitical issues have shown the weak points of global supply chains. Supply chain disruptions like parts supplies, which are scarce, and transport delays have hitherto demonstrated how valued reliable and agile distributors would be. Relying on global electronic components distributors has proved to be sustainable on solutions such as supplier bases diversifications, information technologies in inventory management, and construction of regional distribution centers.

Moreover, several distributors have taken up digitalisation as a solution to the challenges posed by supply chains. Virtual platforms and e-commerce solutions now enable customers to check stock, place orders, and even trace shipments and delivery timelines. Such visibility and ease improves the relationship built between distributors and customers while providing long-term attachment.

The Advancement of Technology in Distribution

How various electronic components are distributed around the globe Is now becoming controlled by technology. Advanced software solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) Have now become part and parcel of the operations of electronic components distributors. Predictive systems assist in demand forecasting, planning inventory to optimal levels, and supply chain risk and disruption.

Similarly, AI-enabled analytics enhance the ability of the components distributors to see which items will be in great demand in the future. So they can purchase them ahead of time to avoid running out In this way, businesses relying on the components can conduct business uninterrupted.

In addition, the use of automation in warehouses operates to improve the speed and efficiency of order processing, reception, and dispatch. Automated mechanisms can help to sort, pack, and ship orders which minimizes chances of error and maximizes customer satisfaction.

Sustainability in Distribution

The need and focus for sustainability have in the modern day prevailed in the core industrial sectors across the world such as the electronics sector. distributors on the other hand are practicing the use of biodegradable packaging for distribution to reduce degradation to the environment. By utilizing recyclable packaging materials and minimizing transportation distances' carbon emissions, distributors are contributing towards making the world greener.

Some distributors are also focusing on manufacturers that use sustainable practices. They are from the perspective of the manufacturers' ecologic footprint, promoting energy-efficient components usage and obsolete electronic parts recycling, thus advancing circular economy within the industry.

The Future of Electronic Components Distribution

Diversification of industries is characteristic for the development and the same applies to that of electronic components distributors. With the increasing use of emerging technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, new demands for specific components will arise. In this regard, it will be necessary to adapt to the trends by broadening the range of items in the product portfolio and improving the level of technical knowledge.

Moreover, the emergences of regional hubs will force the distributors to change their logistics strategy. The construction of local warehouses and distribution centres allows the businesses to meet the demands of local customers at lower transport expenses and shorter delivery time.

The shift towards customer experience is, however, expected to continue. The distributors that deploy modern systems and treat consumers personally are in the competitive edge. This encompasses providing kitted items and other components for complex projects supplemented with undertaking technical assistance.

Conclusion

The electronic components distributor in the global scope are in the epicenter of the ongoing industrial revolution and changing the systems for industries and manufacturers. Their function is quite beyond just providing components; they are enablers of progressive actions so that opportunities are explored and innovation is performed.

These distributors continue to be a profound player in the distribution of electronics by adopting technology, embedding ecological considerations and adjusting to emerging conditions. From facilitating the development and manufacture of self- vehicle systems to the latest gadgets the contributions of electronic components distributors cannot be exaggerated.

Proven ways to boost hotel food and drink profits,Yahoo! Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proven-ways-boost-hotel-food-071458660.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWxpZ29vLmRl&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFFYNooOwugx0Berj_FtJ8KOs_9g240stF9VKDu6IK8BKEYhqAJrwBBl9koyTq2x2-1YsUUnIq57pK3Tng3rRkVQftk_5H06aUU5MRYxnn9lpdHWFdOOgEtEa61yjwZFwjYu-fEBn5gGPM0r6h2wyoM9fz_575BOUW_ItQ0wPTqg,"The hospitality industry is facing unprecedented challenges, from rising operational costs to disrupted supply chains and evolving customer expectations.

Among the areas most impacted by these pressures is food and beverage (F&B) operations, where managing costs while maintaining high-quality service has become a critical concern for hotels.

For many hotel owners and operators, F&B is not only an essential part of the guest experience but also a key profit centre -- yet, it's an area where many are seeing margins erode.

Identifying the food cost margin gap

The difference between your actual profit margin and the potential profit margin in hotel F&B operations is known as the 'margin gap'.

The 'theoretical margin' is what your business could achieve if all operational processes were running perfectly, while the 'current margin' reflects the reality, often diminished by inefficiencies and waste.

The Entegra guide explains, ""Many hotels are losing revenue due to inefficiencies, waste, or missed opportunities that should be enhancing their bottom line.""

With the right strategies in place, it's possible to bridge this gap and optimise F&B operations to boost profitability. However, this process is more complex than it may first appear, and many hotels are finding it difficult to tackle on their own.

Optimising hotel F&B operations

In a time of persistent supply chain disruption, the ability to maintain cost-effective sourcing and ensure ingredient availability is vital. Effective supply chain management is key to optimising F&B operations in hotels.

""By streamlining supply chains, hotels can reduce costs, improve consistency, and maintain quality -- three factors that impact both guest satisfaction and profitability,"" notes the report.

Building strong relationships with suppliers and using technology to predict trends and forecast demand can significantly reduce wastage and prevent overordering.

2. Minimising waste with smart solutions

Food waste is a significant issue for hotels, directly impacting the bottom line.

In hotel F&B operations, every uneaten meal or discarded ingredient is lost revenue. Implementing practices such as portion control, menu design, and repurposing leftovers can have a marked effect on reducing waste.

""By tracking waste against sales data, hotels can gain insights into where the greatest inefficiencies lie,"" the guide suggests.

Hotels can also use technology to monitor waste more accurately, providing staff with the tools they need to adjust practices and reduce unnecessary losses."

Panic hits used car importers as time ticks on 8-year rule,The Star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/business/2024-12-06-panic-hits-used-car-importers-as-time-ticks-on-8-year-rule,"The last time importers were hit by losses on late imports was in 2014, when more than 2,000 used motor vehicles registered in 2006 were locked out of the country.

Importers and dealers of second-hand cars in Kenya are staring at losses that could run into millions of shillings, on the back of delays in deliveries at the Port of Mombasa.

This is as a result of longer shipping time occasioned by disruption in the Red Sea as a result of the Houthi Rebels attacks which have now lasted a year, forcing shipping lines to continue re-routing to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa), before coming up to the East.

For instance, there has been an increased transit time between Mombasa and key global ports from an average 24 days to 40 days, with some ships taking even longer as they call at different ports before the final destination.

According to the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs), vehicles exported to Kenya shall be expected to comply with the eighty-year rule, which includes having a Certificate of Roadworthiness issued by Quality Inspection Services Inc. Japan (QSJ,) which is an inspection company contracted by Kebs.

""Any vehicle registered in 2017 or earlier, arriving after December 31, 2024 will be deemed not compliant and shall be rejected at the importer's expense,"" Kebs managing director Esther Ngari said in a notice issued on November 28.

With only 26 days to go before the December deadline for 2017 units, which locks out vehicles older than eight years under Kenya's second-hand rule, dealers are now worried the country could experience one of the worst incidences on failure to have units cleared on time.

""It could be worst than what we have seen before because unlike previous years where we would make early orders and have then arrive on time, voyages nowadays are unpredictable following the global supply chain disruption. We are seeking engagements with government to see how to avert losses,"" Car Importers Association of Kenya national chairman, Peter Otieno, told the Star yesterday.

The last time importers were hit by losses on late imports was in 2014, when more than 2,000 used motor vehicles registered in 2006 were locked out of the country.

Since then, importers have been beating the deadline with no major lockout reported, save for 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

During the year, more than 18,000 units manufactured in 2013 arrived late as a result of the pandemic's disruption in the shipping industry.

The government allowed clearance of units whose delays were solely as a result of shipping delays."
"RBI Monetary Policy: No Cut! Repo Rate Unchanged For 11th Time In Row, To 6.5%; What Does It Mean?",goodreturns.in,https://www.goodreturns.in/news/rbi-monetary-policy-no-cut-repo-rate-unchanged-for-11th-time-in-row-to-6-5-what-does-it-mean-1392251.html?06122024100733,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50% for the eleventh time in a row on Friday, December 6, 2024. Subsequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25% and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75%. The rate decision is in line with market and economists expectations.

MPC also kept its monetary policy stance to 'neutral' and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth.

In his speech, RBI's governor Shaktikanta Das said, monetary policy is important because it effects the life of people. He added, ""Our effort is to follow the flexible inflation."" He said, price stability is important, but at the same time growth is also important.

RBI's policy decisions revolve around the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent while supporting growth.

RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged since February 2023, after hiking the key rate aggressively by 250 bps from May 2022-February 2023, due to the intense inflation pressure globally after supply-chain disruption escalated as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Currently, geopolitical tensions have continued at a boiling point in Russia and the Middle East.

Also, this is the last policy of RBI governor Shaktikanta Das' first tenure at the central bank. Das' six-year tenure will end on December 10, 2024. He joined RBI as governor on December 11, 2018. Whether the government extends his tenure or not ahead, will be keenly watched. If his tenure is extended, Das will become the longest governor of RBI in India."

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

"Athabasca Oil Announces 2025 Budget Focused on Cash Flow Per Share Growth and Directing 100% of Free Cash Flow to Shareholder Returns | Taiwan News | Dec. 6, 2024 06:23",Taiwan News,https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5985878,"CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athabasca Oil Corporation (TSX: ATH) (""Athabasca"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce its 2025 budget with capital projects that will balance cash flow growth while continuing to deliver a durable return of capital framework that will direct 100% of Free Cash Flow to share buybacks in 2025.

Corporate Consolidated Strategy and Outlook

Value Creation Strategy. Athabasca provides a differentiated liquids-weighted growth platform through its low-decline, long-life Thermal Oil assets. Athabasca's subsidiary company, Duvernay Energy Corporation (""DEC""), is designed to enhance value for Athabasca's shareholders by providing a clear path for self-funded production and cash flow growth in the Kaybob Duvernay resource play. Athabasca (Thermal Oil) and DEC have independent strategies and capital allocation frameworks. The primary strategic objective is to generate top-tier cash flow per share growth over the long term.2025 Consolidated Budget. Athabasca is planning capital expenditures of ~$335 million with average production of 37,500 - 39,500 boe/d (98% Liquids) and an exit rate of ~41,000 boe/d. Growth in production comes from the expansion plans at Leismer and development of the Duvernay assets.Cash Flow Per Share Growth. The Company forecasts consolidated Adjusted Funds Flow between $525 - $550 million1. Every +US$1/bbl move in West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") and Western Canadian Select (""WCS"") heavy oil impacts annual Adjusted Funds Flow by ~$10 million and ~$17 million, respectively. Athabasca forecasts generating ~$1.8 billion of Free Cash Flow1 from its Thermal Oil assets over five years (2025-29), representing ~65% of its current equity market capitalization. Investing in attractive capital projects and prioritizing share buybacks results in ~20% compounded annual cash flow per share2 growth through this forecast period. Financial Resiliency. Athabasca maintains a strong and differentiated balance sheet with a $135 million consolidated Net Cash position, including ~$335 million of cash. DEC has no debt and operates within its annual Adjusted Funds Flow and its balance sheet. Athabasca (Thermal Oil) also has $2.4 billion in tax pools, including $1.9 billion of immediately deductible non-capital loses and exploration pools, sheltering cash taxes until beyond 2030.

Athabasca (Thermal Oil) - 2025 Budget Highlights

Capital Program. The Thermal Oil budget is ~$250 million with activity focused primarily on advancing progressive growth to 40,000 bbl/d at Leismer by the end of 2027. The program at Leismer will include the tie-in of six redrills and four new sustaining well pairs on Pad 10 early in 2025, additional development at Pad 10 and 11, and continued facility expansion work. At Hangingstone two new extended reach sustaining well pairs (~1,400 meter average laterals) will be on stream in Q1 2025 and are expected to maintain annual production. The Budget includes routine maintenance at both assets.Production Growth. Annual Thermal Oil production guidance is 33,500 - 35,500 bbl/d. Leismer is expected to achieve 40,000 bbl/d by the end of 2027 at an attractive capital efficiency of ~$25,000/bbl/d. Hangingstone production will be maintained by utilizing existing plant capacity, resulting in capital efficiencies of ~$15,000/bbl/d. The Company has ~1.2 billion barrels of Proved plus Probable reserves and ~1 billion of Contingent Resource. These Thermal Oil assets underpin decades of reserve life with estimated sustaining capital investment of ~C$8/bbl (five-year annual average) to hold production flat.Robust Free Cash Flow. During the five-year time frame (2025-29), Athabasca (Thermal Oil) forecasts generating $1.8 billion in Free Cash Flow1, representing ~65% of its current equity market capitalization.Competitive and Resilient Break-evens. Thermal Oil is competitively positioned with sustaining capital to hold production flat funded within cash flow below US$50/bbl WTI1 and growth initiatives fully funded within cash flow below US$60/bbl WTI1. The Company's operating break-even is estimated at ~US$40/bbl WTI1.Exposure to Strong Heavy Oil Pricing. With the start-up of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in May, spare pipeline capacity is driving tighter and less volatile WCS heavy differentials. Regional liquids pricing benchmarks have also been supported by a depreciating Canadian currency relative to the United States. Every +US$1/bbl move in West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") and WCS heavy oil impacts annual Adjusted Funds Flow by ~$10 million and ~$17 million, respectively.Pre-payout Thermal Oil Differentiation. Strong margins and Free Cash Flow are supported by a Thermal Oil pre-payout Crown royalty structure, with royalty rates between 5 - 9% anticipated to last to the end of 2027 at Leismer and beyond 2030 at Hangingstone.

Duvernay Energy Corporation - 2025 Budget Highlights

Capital Program. The DEC budget is ~$85 million with activity including the completion of a 100% working interest (""WI"") three-well pad that was drilled in 2024 and the drilling and completion of a 30% WI multi-well pad. Activity will also include spudding two additional multi-well pads in H2 2025 (one operated 100% WI pad and one 30% WI pad) with completions to follow in 2026. DEC is also constructing strategic water and egress expansions on its operated assets.High Netback Production. Annual production guidance is ~4,000 boe/d (77% Liquids) with growth to ~5,500 boe/d by the end of 2025. The Kaybob Duvernay's high liquid weighting supports strong margins with current type wells forecasted to payout in ~13 months1 and further cost improvements are expected as the Company executes larger multi-well pad design.Growth Plans. Development will be self-funded within DEC through utilization of 100% of its annual Adjusted Funds Flow and its balance sheet. The Company has self-funded growth potential to in excess of ~20,000 boe/d (75% Liquids) by the late 2020s1.

Return of Capital

100% of Free Cash Flow Directed to Share Buybacks. In 2025, the Company plans to maintain its commitment to return 100% of Thermal Oil Free Cash Flow to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2024, the Company has completed ~$280 million in share buybacks to the end of November. Share buybacks were initiated in April 2023 and have totaled ~$440 million to date. Focus on Per Share Metrics: A steadfast commitment to cash flow growth and return of capital has driven a 108 million share reduction (~17%) in the Company's fully diluted share count since March 31, 2023. The Company has realized ~100% cash flow per share growth since 2022 and the corporate strategy is to continue to generate top tier cash flow per share growth over the long term.

Also included in this News Release are estimates of Athabasca's 2024 outlook which are based on the various assumptions as to production levels, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and other assumptions disclosed in this News Release. To the extent any such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Athabasca and is included to provide readers with an understanding of the Company's outlook. Management does not have firm commitments for all of the costs, expenditures, prices or other financial assumptions used to prepare the financial outlook or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects of all of those costs, expenditures, prices and operating results are not objectively determinable. The actual results of operations of the Company and the resulting financial results may vary from the amounts set forth herein, and such variations may be material. The outlook and forward-looking information contained in this New Release was made as of the date of this News release and the Company disclaims any intention or obligations to update or revise such outlook and/or forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

Oil and Gas Information

""BOEs"" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Initial Production Rates

Test Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

Reserves Information

The McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company's AIF.

Reserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.

The 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca's multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.

"Key Risk Trends For Directors And Officers In 2025: Insolvencies, Geopolitical Tension And ""AI Washing"": Allianz - InfoStride News",InfoStride News,https://www.theinfostride.com/key-risk-trends-for-directors-and-officers-in-2025-insolvencies-geopolitical-tension-and-ai-washing-allianz/,"""The D&O insurance market has remained competitive for buyers over the past year, but loss potential is still high,"" says

Insolvencies as an emerging D&O risk

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

Third-party litigation funding a growing exposure

The global litigation funding industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years -by almost 10% CAGR up to 2028 - widening access to justice, but also potentially driving up the number of class actions and settlement costs and damages, as also highlighted in Allianz Commercial's Five Liability Loss Trends To Watch report. And it is not only confined to the US - third-party litigation funding is also established in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.

""D&Os will face increasing scrutiny from third parties ready to jump on cases and fund them. Claims are likely to become more complex because of funders' aggressive litigation strategies and the experts they can afford to hire,"" says Schlesinger. ""Plaintiffs with little to lose financially could be tempted to make baseless claims. Even if the case doesn't have legs, directors still have to defend it.""

Challenges persist in Asia D&O market

The price-driven Asia D&O market has experienced a drop in overall premium rates during 2024, due to factors including high competition from an abundance of capacity globally, and challenging economic environments resulting in some clients reducing limits purchased to save costs.

""We foresee the overall market size for D&O in 2025 will continue to retract, driven by rate erosion, smaller limits being purchased by customers, and very limited new opportunities given slow capital market activities. Despite this, D&O insurance remains crucial for companies due to the multiple exposures executives face, and as loss potential increases with higher severity for claims being resolved,"" says Danielle An, Regional Practice Leader, Management Liability Commercial, Asia, at Allianz Commercial.

10 of the restaurant industry's most impactful bankruptcies of 2024,Restaurant Dive,https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/looking-back-at-2024s-restaurant-bankruptcy-wave/734528/,"While dozens of brands and operators filed for bankruptcy in 2024, a sample of major filings show a range of problems from rising labor costs to low traffic.

This year's myriad restaurant bankruptcies make it possible to draw many individual lessons about tactics that burdened balance sheets.

But if the filings of bankrupt brands and operators elucidate specific, flawed business practices, like Thai Union Group's sale-leaseback process at Red Lobster, are there generalizable lessons, given the sheer number of bankruptcies?

The short answer is rising prices. Restaurants raised prices 30% in five years, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics Data collated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, while overall prices went up 22% and grocery prices went up 27%. Eventually, many consumers pulled back. At the same time, capital became more difficult to raise starting in 2022, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. This tightened the money supply and increased the cost of borrowing money.

Strong brands and concepts, particularly fast casuals that offer significant perceived value, have done very well in this environment. But brands with weaker value propositions, worse unit economics and burdened balance sheets fell behind.

""Even in the best of times, there are still companies that are either stressed or distressed,"" Brad Sandler, a partner at the bankruptcy and restructuring law firm Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones, told Restaurant Dive.

Sandler said that consumer health overall is strong but that prolonged operational challenges in a thin-margin business like restaurants makes it difficult for companies with a lot of debt to turn things around.

Bankruptcies were more common in ""consumer-facing industries that have been adversely affected by the economy,"" Sandler said. ""From supply chain disruption to rising labor costs to geopolitical tensions there's been a tremendous amount of disruption.""

Local conditions impacted specific brands as well. Rising labor costs associated with California's $20 fast food wage helped seal Rubio's fate. Sticky's Finger Joint was hurt by particularly low foot traffic in Manhattan. Roti's bankruptcy was hastened by the end of rent deferral agreements. At One Table Restaurants, the parent company of Tender Greens and Tocaya, high commission fees on third-party delivery ate up much of the brands' recovery from COVID-19.

Franchisee bankruptcies, one of 2023's most alarming trends, continued apace this year. One Dickey's Barbecue franchisee filed for Chapter 11 protections as the chain's store system shrank. Arby's franchisee Miracle Restaurant Group went bankrupt in the summer after failing to find a buyer for underperforming units. And in casual dining, Louisiana Apple went bankrupt after a creditor sued and Applebee's stripped it of control of its stores.

With the end of the year approaching and some of 2024 bankrupt chains emerging from the Chapter 11 process with fresh plans for turnarounds, take a look back on some of the year's most impactful bankruptcies."
TSMC in talks with Nvidia to make new AI Blackwell chips in Arizona,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tsmc-in-talks-nvidia-blackwell-chips-arizona/,"The final packaging of these AI chips still needs to be done in Taiwan because the Arizona plant lacks the required resources.

TSMC is in talks with Nvidia Corp to make the Nvidia artificial intelligence Blackwell chips at its new factory in Arizona.

According to a recent report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd is ready to begin production at the Arizona facility early next year. The information was revealed by three sources who asked not to be identified as these discussions are confidential.

US plants are part of efforts to limit supply chain disruption

Introduced in March, Nvidia's Blackwell chips have been manufactured in TSMC plants in Taiwan so far. Potential clients for these highly demanded chips are companies working in generative AI and accelerated computing.

Nvidia claims these Blackwell chips work 30 times faster than earlier models at tasks like providing answers for a chatbot. The company announced that it fixed design flaws in October.

If finalized, the deal will make Nvidia one of the major customers of TSMC's Arizona plant, which will begin large-scale production next year. Neither has commented on the update.

Recently, the U.S. has added more restrictions to limit China from accessing advanced tech used for semiconductor manufacturing on national security grounds. On the other hand, China has retaliated as well by limiting exports of key materials used in the production of chips.

TSMC's efforts to set up manufacturing plants inside the U.S. are part of the chip maker's strategies to minimize single-region dependency. The semiconductor giant is expanding operations in Arizona in part to ensure a more resilient supply chain for its clients, which also includes Nvidia.

Apple and AMD are also customers of TSMC's Arizona plant

Apple and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are among the clients of the Taiwanese chipmaker's Arizona plant as per two sources. Both Apple and AMD did not comment on the matter as well.

While the initial stages of the manufacturing of Nvidia's Blackwell chips will take place in TSMC's Arizona plant, the final packaging needs to happen back in Taiwan.

This is because the plant in Arizona does not have the advanced chip packaging technology known as chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) necessary to make Blackwell chips. All of TSMC CoW's operations so far are in Taiwan.

The world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, is pouring billions into the U.S. with three plants planned in Phoenix. The U.S. government is supporting these projects with large subsidies as part of a larger effort to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Post-Brexit border delays threaten UK protected edibles growers and crop supply,FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/europe/article/9685132/post-brexit-border-delays-threaten-uk-protected-edibles-growers-and-crop-supply/,"The next 8 weeks is a short, but critical window in the UK Protected Edibles calendar, with growers importing seeds and/or young plants into the UK in preparation for next season's crop, ensuring supermarket shelves are well stocked with high-quality British produce in 2025.

British Protected Edibles Growers are extremely concerned about the new BTOM checking and testing regimes at the UK border, brought in earlier this year, which are already causing significant delays to seed and plants reaching their destinations, and rather than re-assure, raise serious alarms around plant health and biosecurity. The phytosanitary measures already taken in the protected edible cropping supply chain are exceptional, but we believe these measures will and are being compromised through the checks taking place at border control points (BCPs), jeopardizing the health and quality of seeds and plants reaching growers and posing undue additional risks to grower businesses.

Whilst as an industry we are working with partners including the NFU, Defra, APHA to resolve this, and productive conversations are being had, not enough is being done to allay these very real concerns or rapidly develop pragmatic, safe, and workable solutions. The checks being carried out at the border are not proportionate to the level of embedded biosecurity already in the protected edible supply chain, and the risks to crops are not being sufficiently mitigated.

Key concerns:

Changes to import regulations, following Brexit, and the need for additional processes including seed testing and plant checks/testing at BCPs, are resulting in significant delays in the release of seeds for sowing and plants for planting, thus causing major supply chain disruption to the UK-protected edibles industry. Regarding the plant inspections at BCP's, we have serious and founded concerns about inadequate biosecurity measures, cross-contamination risk, lack of careful handling and uncontrolled holding conditions. The protected edibles supply chain has a very effective, embedded biosecure supply chain from seed producers to propagators to grower nurseries, which is being inherently put at risk by these additional processes, and we have not been reassured that our concerns are being taken seriously. Seed houses have reported testing delays of over 6 weeks in some cases of batches being sent to the UK, primarily caused by the turnround times for additional plant pathogen testing (already carried out at source), which makes crop programming and planning extremely difficult, thus causing significant negative economic impact - the burden of which is primarily with UK growers. Seed of European origin is already tested and certified to an equivalent standard as disease free before being dispatched to GB, making additional testing in the UK an unnecessary, costly and t ime-consuming duplication. A reciprocal phytosanitary agreement with the EU would mitigate many of these delays in this respect.

Shippers eye alternatives as Indian port workers prepare for 'indefinite' strike - The Loadstar,The Loadstar,https://theloadstar.com/shippers-eye-alternatives-as-indian-port-workers-prepare-for-indefinite-strike/,"Indian shippers are braced for major supply chain disruption after dockworkers call for strikes at key ports, claiming the government is still falling short of commitments.

The Loadstar previously reported that a consortium of labour groups in India told port authorities workers would stage indefinite work stoppages across ports from 17 December, in protest at the lack of action to address long-standing labour concerns.

The unions today confirmed their promise of ""an indefinite strike"", should the government fail to implement wage revisions and productivity schemes before 15 December.

There are 12 government-controlled ports in India, but over the past decade privately owned ports, particularly in the container sector, have taken increasing amounts of market share - the Adani-owned port of Mundra has overtaken Nhava Sheva to become India's busiest container gateway. Similarly, Chennai has ceded a significant portion of its southern Indian containerised trade to nearby Adani facilities at Kattupalli and Ennore.

Co-founder and director of Kale logistics Vineet Malhotra told The Loadstar: ""As it is expected that only government ports might strike, and the private ports would still operate, shippers would mitigate by moving their shipments through the private ports as an alternative approach for the short-term.""

But Jitendra Srivastava, CEO of Triton Logistics & Maritime, warned that if many shippers shifted to private ports, this would lead to higher costs and delays in cargo handling and clearance. He advised shippers to explore alternative shipping routes and to consider air freight, particularly for perishables.

Indeed, Mr Malhotra also advised: ""In case of lighter cargo, shippers might end-up utilising the air freight mode.""

He added: ""The centre of all this will be technology enabled real-time monitoring, that will help shippers make quick adjustments.""

A productivity linked reward scheme remains at the heart of the impasse at the ports and needs to be approved by the federal government retroactively to 2021. With no guidelines in place, interim retirees from the ports have lost out on benefits, unions claim.

""The workers and pensioners are restless, and [they are] compelled to go on industrial action against the non-implementation of statutory settlements,"" the labour groups said.

According to IPA sources, the ministry of shipping needed to issue an order approving wage revisions for port workers, which ""has been delayed"", one official told The Loadstar last month.

Funding to cover additional overheads by the government ports, amid growing market share challenges from the private port sector, could be a major reason pushing the decision back at government level, according to industry observers.

Nonetheless, Mr Malhorta remained optimistic that negotiations during the 10-day countdown to a strike notice would ultimately prove productive."

"Key Risk Trends For Directors And Officers In 2025: Insolvencies, Geopolitical Tension And ""AI washing"": Allianz",Brand Spur,https://brandspurng.com/2024/12/05/key-risk-trends-for-directors-and-officers-in-2025-insolvencies-geopolitical-tension-and-ai-washing-allianz-2/,"D&O market remains competitive but a step up in scrutiny of corporate conduct around the globe means loss potential is still high.

Munich, December 5, 2024 - Directors and Officers (D&Os) have been operating in a highly complex environment throughout 2024, and further volatility can be expected during 2025. Executives face multiple exposures in an increasingly interconnected business world, confronted with risks arising from business insolvencies, geopolitical upheaval, climate change, digital transformation, economic uncertainty, shifts in public opinion, and an evolving legal landscape. These are the latest key risk trends in the D&O insurance space, as identified by Allianz Commercial's annual Directors and Officers Insurance Insights report.

""The D&O insurance market has remained competitive for buyers over the past year, but loss potential is still high,"" says Vanessa Maxwell, Chief Underwriting Officer, Allianz Commercial. ""The global rise in business insolvencies is a particular focus of concern, with companies and leaders exposed to potential claims from lenders seeking to recover funds, or from shareholders who allege breach of fiduciary duty. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, and we are seeing regulatory bodies across the globe step up scrutiny of corporate conduct, making D&Os more vulnerable to investigations, penalties and lawsuits.""

Insolvencies as an emerging D&O risk

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to Allianz Trade. Major insolvencies already increased by +26% year-on-year for the first three quarters of 2024 (344 cases). Western Europe leads the global count with 195 cases, a reflection of the region's current economic instability, followed by Asia-Pacific (67 cases) and North America (66 cases). Rising bankruptcies typically lead to an increase in D&O claims, so this trend is a reminder to business leaders of the need to respond and adapt to the challenging environment.

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

Third-party litigation funding a growing exposure

The global litigation funding industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years -by almost 10% CAGR up to 2028 - widening access to justice, but also potentially driving up the number of class actions and settlement costs and damages, as also highlighted in Allianz Commercial's Five Liability Loss Trends To Watch report. And it is not only confined to the US - third-party litigation funding is also established in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.

""D&Os will face increasing scrutiny from third parties ready to jump on cases and fund them. Claims are likely to become more complex because of funders' aggressive litigation strategies and the experts they can afford to hire,"" says Schlesinger. ""Plaintiffs with little to lose financially could be tempted to make baseless claims. Even if the case doesn't have legs, directors still have to defend it."""

Indonesian interest rate cuts seen to narrow in 2025,The Star ,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/12/05/indonesian-interest-rate-cuts-seen-to-narrow-in-2025,"JAKARTA: Bank Indonesia (BI) governor Perry Warjiyo has signalled that the central bank will have less room for continued monetary policy easing next year as pressure mounts on the rupiah as a result of the more inward-looking policy expected from the administration of United States president-elect Donald Trump.

""Global turmoil has pushed us to focus on rupiah stabilisation,"" Perry said in his keynote speech at the BI annual meeting in Jakarta last Friday, adding that BI's policy rate would be adjusted in accordance with ""global and domestic economic dynamics"".

He added that BI was continuing to look for room to cut its benchmark rates as inflation was expected to remain steady in the next two years and as lower interest rates were needed to drive economic growth.

Aside from changes to the BI rate, the central bank's toolbox to protect the rupiah includes foreign exchange market intervention and so-called macroprudential incentives, which are offered by BI to banks extending loans to priority sectors and small businesses in the form of lower reserve requirements.

Perry said Trump's return to office would ""bring big changes to the world's geopolitical and economic landscape"" that would dim the world's economy in the next two years, and he indicated how it pressed the central bank to act accordingly.

Speaking at the same event, President Prabowo Subianto said geopolitics was ""in a rather sensitive situation full of uncertainty, necessitating us to remain alert, always careful.

""But I am grateful that the overall situation in remains calm and conducive"".

Perry said import tariffs, trade wars, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and economic and financial fragmentation were adding to global uncertainty and would play out in various ways.

He said a slower and diverging economic growth, where the US would see better days while China and Europe would experience weakness.

Supply chain disruption and trade wars, Perry said, would see inflation pressure ""re-emerge"".

The annual inflation rate in Indonesia dropped to 1.55% in November, according to official data published on Monday, inching close to the low end of BI's target range of between 1.5% and 3.5%. -- The Jakarta Post/ANN"

""We foresee the overall market size for D&O in 2025 will continue to retract, driven by rate erosion, smaller limits being purchased by customers, and very limited new opportunities given slow capital market activities.

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to Allianz Trade. Major insolvencies already increased by +26% year-on-year for the first three quarters of 2024 (344 cases). Western Europe leads the global count with 195 cases, a reflection of the region's current economic instability, followed by Asia-Pacific (67 cases) and North America (66 cases). Rising bankruptcies typically lead to an increase in D&O claims, so this trend is a reminder to business leaders of the need to respond and adapt to the challenging environment.

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

Third-party litigation funding a growing exposure

The global litigation funding industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years -by almost 10% CAGR up to 2028 - widening access to justice, but also potentially driving up the number of class actions and settlement costs and damages, as also highlighted in Allianz Commercial's Five Liability Loss Trends To Watch report. And it is not only confined to the US - third-party litigation funding is also established in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.

""D&Os will face increasing scrutiny from third parties ready to jump on cases and fund them. Claims are likely to become more complex because of funders' aggressive litigation strategies and the experts they can afford to hire,"" says Schlesinger. ""Plaintiffs with little to lose financially could be tempted to make baseless claims. Even if the case doesn't have legs, directors still have to defend it.""

Challenges persist in Asia D&O market

The price-driven Asia D&O market has experienced a drop in overall premium rates during 2024, due to factors including high competition from an abundance of capacity globally, and challenging economic environments resulting in some clients reducing limits purchased to save costs.

""We foresee the overall market size for D&O in 2025 will continue to retract, driven by rate erosion, smaller limits being purchased by customers, and very limited new opportunities given slow capital market activities. Despite this, D&O insurance remains crucial for companies due to the multiple exposures executives face, and as loss potential increases with higher severity for claims being resolved,"" says Danielle An, Regional Practice Leader, Management Liability Commercial, Asia, at Allianz Commercial.

"Key risk trends for Directors and Officers in 2025: insolvencies, geopolitical tension and ""AI washing"": Allianz - HR ASIA",HR ASIA,https://hr.asia/media-outreach/key-risk-trends-for-directors-and-officers-in-2025-insolvencies-geopolitical-tension-and-ai-washing-allianz/,"SINGAPORE - Media OutReach Newswire - 5 December 2024 - Directors and Officers (D&Os) have been operating in a highly complex environment throughout 2024, and further volatility can be expected during 2025. Executives face multiple exposures in an increasingly interconnected business world, confronted with risks arising from business insolvencies, geopolitical upheaval, climate change, digital transformation, economic uncertainty, shifts in public opinion, and an evolving legal landscape. These are the latest key risk trends in the D&O insurance space, as identified by Allianz Commercial's annual Directors and Officers Insurance Insights report.

""The D&O insurance market has remained competitive for buyers over the past year, but loss potential is still high,"" says Vanessa Maxwell, Chief Underwriting Officer, Allianz Commercial. ""The global rise in business insolvencies is a particular focus of concern, with companies and leaders exposed to potential claims from lenders seeking to recover funds, or from shareholders who allege breach of fiduciary duty. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, and we are seeing regulatory bodies across the globe step up scrutiny of corporate conduct, making D&Os more vulnerable to investigations, penalties and lawsuits.""

Insolvencies as an emerging D&O risk

Global business insolvencies for 2024 are expected to rise by +11%, and countries accounting for more than half of global GDP will be hit by double-digit insolvency increases in 2024, according to Allianz Trade. Major insolvencies already increased by +26% year-on-year for the first three quarters of 2024 (344 cases). Western Europe leads the global count with 195 cases, a reflection of the region's current economic instability, followed by Asia-Pacific (67 cases) and North America (66 cases). Rising bankruptcies typically lead to an increase in D&O claims, so this trend is a reminder to business leaders of the need to respond and adapt to the challenging environment.

""Many companies have faced higher interest expenses, inflationary pressures, and macro- and microeconomic headwinds that have impacted their business and resulted in a struggle to service their debt load,"" says Dan Holloway, Head of Global Management Liability Commercial at Allianz Commercial. ""Some sectors are particularly exposed, including real estate, construction, hospitality, tourism, and businesses in 'consumer discretionary', or non-essential purchases.""

Turbulent geopolitical environment and stringent litigation landscape

With war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the geopolitical landscape presents liability challenges to businesses as they find themselves caught up in world events with potentially significant consequences for their operations. Upheaval can lead to supply chain disruption, business interruption, and legal and regulatory scrutiny. Companies can face scrutiny for non-compliance with international sanctions, or for failing to adequately manage risks related to politically unstable regions. D&Os can be held accountable for misjudging the impact of geopolitical developments on their company's operations, leading to shareholder lawsuits or regulatory penalties. At the same time, the litigation landscape and enforcement are increasingly stringent, with securities class actions proliferating not only in the US, but also in Europe (+10% year-on-year) and Australia (+43%).

""D&Os need to update their knowledge around geopolitical and regulatory changes more regularly than ever before,"" says Jarrod Schlesinger, Global Head of Financial Lines and Cyber at Allianz Commercial. ""A once-a-year review is no longer sufficient in the volatile era businesses are now operating in. These trends are driving the need for D&O policies that are responsive to multi-jurisdictional risks and can provide local coverage for legal defense costs, settlements and other liabilities.""

""AI washing"" - the new ""greenwashing""?

The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is huge, but it also means companies must adapt quickly to potential exposures around disclosure, regulation, shareholder scrutiny and litigation. AI-related litigation is increasing and exaggerated claims about firms' technological capabilities - a trend known as ""AI washing"" - could lead to securities class action lawsuits and enforcement actions. Class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US, but the risk extends beyond North America, as any company that has its stock listed on a US exchange is subject to US securities law.

Third-party litigation funding a growing exposure

The global litigation funding industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years -by almost 10% CAGR up to 2028 - widening access to justice, but also potentially driving up the number of class actions and settlement costs and damages, as also highlighted in Allianz Commercial's Five Liability Loss Trends To Watch report. And it is not only confined to the US - third-party litigation funding is also established in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.

""D&Os will face increasing scrutiny from third parties ready to jump on cases and fund them. Claims are likely to become more complex because of funders' aggressive litigation strategies and the experts they can afford to hire,"" says Schlesinger. ""Plaintiffs with little to lose financially could be tempted to make baseless claims. Even if the case doesn't have legs, directors still have to defend it.""

Challenges persist in Asia D&O market

The price-driven Asia D&O market has experienced a drop in overall premium rates during 2024, due to factors including high competition from an abundance of capacity globally, and challenging economic environments resulting in some clients reducing limits purchased to save costs.

""We foresee the overall market size for D&O in 2025 will continue to retract, driven by rate erosion, smaller limits being purchased by customers, and very limited new opportunities given slow capital market activities. Despite this, D&O insurance remains crucial for companies due to the multiple exposures executives face, and as loss potential increases with higher severity for claims being resolved,"" says Danielle An, Regional Practice Leader, Management Liability Commercial, Asia, at Allianz Commercial.

"GoodReturns Poll: Timing Is Key! RBI Likely To Cut Repo Rate By 25 Bps But Not On December 6, When?",goodreturns.in,https://www.goodreturns.in/news/goodreturns-poll-timing-is-key-rbi-likely-to-cut-repo-rate-by-25-bps-but-not-on-december-6-when-1391967.html?04122024222322,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep repo rate unchanged for the eleventh time in a row. The reason by a group of economists is attributed to be the sharp surge in the CPI inflation rate, and the slowest growth in the economy in two years. Further, RBI is predicted to hike its inflation target and lower GDP forecast for upcoming quarter, as per a poll of 30 economists conducted by GoodReturns.In. The easing cycle in key interest rates is estimated to begin from February 2025 policy, which will be the first RBI rate cut in 2 years.

Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda said, ""The uncertain global environment and recent inflation trends (averaging 5.9% in the last two months) suggest that the RBI is likely to maintain the current repo rate.""

Among key changes expected on Friday, in the poll, 6 economists believe that RBI will raise its CPI inflation and trim its GDP target for Q3FY25.

Bank of Baroda economist said, ""There could be a change in RBI projections for both inflation and GDP as inflation has been higher so far than the RBI forecast for Q3 and GDP growth is expected to be lower in Q2. It would hence be of interest to see what the projections this time are. While liquidity is tight presently, any measure to augment the same will be indicative of the RBI view on the permanency of this situation.""

Explaining further in the poll, Emkay Global Financial believes that the timing and window of the rate cut is tricky.

""Even as the RBI's growth/inflation forecast will see significant downward/upward revisions, an immediate rate cut may not be easy for the MPC to justify, especially as their commentary has been assertive on durable disinflation being the primary mandate. Nonetheless, the pressure on convention easing is only going to mount as growth looks structurally pale. The timing and window of cuts is tricky and small amid fluid global dynamics, while the RBI may also want to weigh the FX cost of rate cuts (liquidity implication/sterilization cost, and imported inflation),"" Emkay said.

In total 20 economists are predicting a rate cut in February 2025 policy by 25 bps. While some 5 economists believe a rate cut for FY26 will be in the range of 50-100 bps.

Rahul Bajoria, Head of India and ASEAN Economic Research at BofA Securities, ""With slowing growth and potential return of headline CPI within the target band for a durable period, we see the window to cut rates opening in February, subject to global factors being conducive for rate moves. If the INR is broadly well-behaved and growth is weak, the RBI should be on track to cut rates once the supply shocks fade. We maintain our rate cut call in February MPC and continue to expect 100bp of cuts in the cycle, given a durable alignment of headline CPI close to 4% through 2025. This will bring the repo rate to 5.50% by end-2025, which we identify as being close to the neutral rate.""

However, these economists also predict that there is an open window for RBI to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR).

SBI Capital Markets said, that though a Dec'24 rate cut remains remote, the RBI may move to ease liquidity for productive uses in the economy by cutting the CRR. The government too may rapidly ramp up its revenue expenditure to provide support to the economy.

Here are the key outcomes of the poll:

December 2024 Policy: No Rate Cut, Repo Rate Seen At 6.50% In Q3 Of FY25. Cut In CRR Expected.

February 2025 Policy: 25 Bps Rate Cut, Repo Rate Cut Seen At 6.25% For Q4 and FY25-End.

RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged since February 2023, after hiking the key rate aggressively by 250 bps from May 2022-February 2023, due to the intense inflation pressure globally after supply-chain disruption escalated as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Currently, geopolitical tensions have continued at a boiling point in Russia and the Middle East.

CareEdge is expecting MPC to revise its inflation projection for FY25 upwards, aligning it closely to the 4.8% target, which is still higher than RBI's lower tolerance limit of 4%. While the rating agency is predicting a 6.5% growth rate for GDP for FY25.

Currently, the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) is unchanged at 6.50%. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25% and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75%.

In the October 2024 policy, the key decision of RBI was to change the monetary policy stance to 'neutral' and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth.

CPI inflation jumped sharply to 6.21% in October 2024, crossing RBI's upper tolerance limit of 6% for the first time in over 1 year. Meanwhile, India's GDP growth witnessed a setback, by hitting a staggering 5.4% which is the slowest growth in two years. Q2 GDP data missed market estimates of 6.5%, and RBI's target of 7%.

Six-members monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting has commenced from December 4th onward, and its outcome will be announced on December 6th. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das is chairing the 3-day meeting."
Power 100 2024: who are this year's Power Players?,Drapers,https://www.drapersonline.com/insight/power-100-2024-who-are-this-years-power-players,"Frasers Group, H&M, Inditex, JD Sports Fashion, John Lewis Partnership, Marks & Spencer, Next and Primark make up this year's Power Players.

2024 was a year of celebration for Primark: the value retailer marked 50 years on the British high street, since opening its first UK store in Derby in September 1974. CEO Paul Marchant - one of fashion retail's most respected leaders - has been at the helm since 2009, and presides over 451 stores globally, including 185 in Britain.

In 2024, Marchant pushed ahead with Primark's international expansion and continued investment in stores. The retailer is injecting more than £100m in its UK stores this year including three new openings, three relocations and two extensions. It also entered its 17th market by opening its first store in Hungary in May as part of ambitious plans to reach 530 stores by the end of 2026.

Marchant has continued to expand Primark's digital offering to drive growth, despite having no transactional website. He extended click and collect, first launched in November 2022, to further 54 stores across the UK this year, taking the total number of sites offering the service to 111. The retailer aims to roll out click and collect to all 185 stores in Britain by the end of 2025.

Primark reported a 6% rise in revenue to £9.4bn for the year to 14 September, which it attributed to improvements in its store experience and digital engagement. Operating profit rose 53% to £1.1bn during the period, driven by lower material costs and reduced realised freight costs, as well as the annualisation of price increases in the prior year.

Marchant has put inclusivity at the heart of the business. The retailer announced a partnership with designer and disability rights advocate Victoria Jenkins in July to introduce more adaptive clothing into stores. This follows the launch of its first adaptive underwear collection in January. It also unveiled a 37-piece collection designed for those affected by breast cancer in October.

It has been another year of international and domestic expansion for Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct, USC, Flannels and House of Frasers, among others. CEO Michael Murray has been steering the company to new heights after taking over from his father-in-law, Mike Ashley, in May 2022.

In the UK, the group bought luxury etailer Coggles from THG as part of a multi-year partnership between the two businesses, and expanded its property portfolio with the acquisitions of Princesshay shopping centre estate in Exeter, Fremlin Walk shopping centre in Maidstone, Olympus Centre in Gloucester and Frenchgate shopping centre in Doncaster. It has also continued to snap up fashion independents including Northampton's Thackerays and Sunderland's Aphrodite.

Murray is forging ahead with the group's global ambitions too. It bought a 14.65% stake in Australia and New Zealand's retailer and distributor business Accent and announced plans to opening 12 Sports Direct stores in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium by the end of the year, following the acquisitions of Sprinter and Twin Sport.

Under Murray's leadership, Frasers posted a 13.1% rise in adjusted profit before tax to £544.8m in the year to 28 April 2024, despite a 0.9% revenue dip. The group highlighted that it has made progress on its elevation strategy and strengthened brand partnerships, including onboarding new brands such as The North Face, On and Columbia.

However, the year was not without controversy. Frasers made a £12.5m loss from its acquisition of Matches, which it put into administration in March before buying back certain intellectual property assets.

Henrik Nordvall, country manager, UK and Ireland, H&M

Henrik Nordvall, CEO of H&M UK and Ireland, has spent 16 years with H&M, holding nine different roles across six markets. Having been in his current role since September 2022, Nordvall is re-igniting the Swedish high street conglomerate in the UK with collaborations, new product categories and fresh store concepts.

The company owns H&M, H&M Home, & Other Stories, Arket, Cheap Monday, Cos, Monki and Weekday, spanning more than 4,200 stores around the world. Flagship brand H&M boasts 3,832 stores worldwide with 188 in the UK.

However, it is not exempt from pressure on consumer budgets and ongoing supply chain disruption. The group reported ""slow sales"" in the third quarter to 31 August 2024 with operating profit falling 25% to SEK3.5bn (£250m) and net sales down 3% to SEK59bn (£4.35bn).

Nordvall is betting on collaborations including teaming up with music artist Charlie XCX for its autumn/winter 24 campaign to capture consumer interest. The company has also ventured into new categories such as premium childrenswear sub-brand H&M Adorables, which launched in October, and continued its store investment.

This year, H&M has opened five new stores in the UK and relaunched eight, including a refreshed Stratford store. It unveiled a new concept store on Chelsea's King's Road in March, carrying a curated edit of its ""most fashion-forward"" womenswear, accessories and beauty lines.

Nordvall believes the key to success lies in the product offerings: ""The best products will always win. It's really a game of making the best products, and we're on that. This is the journey we own.""

Global fashion powerhouse Inditex remains as one of the few businesses prospering on the high street, fuelled by its trend-led designs, agile operations and diverse brand portfolio. The owner of Zara, Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho and Lefties posted a 7.2% year-on-year increase in revenue to €18.1bn (£15.3bn) for the six months to 31 July 2024 as a result of ""well-received"" spring/summer collections.

At the helm of the Spanish conglomerate is Marta Ortega - the daughter of Inditex founder Amancio Ortega - who has been chair of the company since April 2022.

Under her leadership, the company biggest fast fashion company in the world has continued to strengthen the physical presence of all its brands in the UK: its sportswear brand Oysho opened its second UK store in Westfield Stratford City in March; Zara upsized to a former Debenhams unit in Glasgow's Silverburn shopping centre and an ex-Topshop site at Trinity shopping centre in Leeds; Pull & Bear made its Welsh debut in St David's shopping centre in Cardiff. The group now has 5,667 stores in total globally, including 1,792 Zara stores.

Ortega has been introducing new initiatives within the business. Zara expanded its live shopping experience to the UK, Europe and the US this year after first launching the format on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, last November to boost online sales. Zara pre-owned platform, which was already available in 16 European markets including the UK, launched in US in October.

Richard Price, managing director of clothing and home, and Stuart Machin, CEO, Marks & Spencer

Marks & Spencer is on an upward trajectory under the stewardship of Richard Price as managing director of clothing and home, and Stuart Machin as CEO.

After returning to the FTSE100 in autumn 2023, the retailer reported a 9.3% rise year on year in group revenues to £13bn for the year to 30 March. Within the clothing and home division, sales grew 5.3%, led by a 7.8% rise in online sales with the M&S app accounting for 44% of online orders. For the 26 weeks to 28 September, profit before tax and adjusting items was up 17.2% to £407.8m, and market share growth was driven by womenswear.

It comes four years after the retailer launched its ""Never the Same Again"" programme, which includes reshuffling its store portfolio, strengthening its product design, bolstering its digital offering and introducing third-party brands. Machin, who became CEO in 2022 and Price, who took up his current position in 2020, have been accelerating the turnaround plan and investing in the future.

This year, M&S unveiled a £30m investment in its Scottish stores with five new openings and expansions by June 2025 and another £30m in London, renewing and modernising 12 existing sites. It also plans to open two full-line flagship stores in Bath and Bristol as part of a £38m investment, and opened its first clothing-only store in London's Battersea Power Station in November.

Price and Machin have continued to revive the retailer's fashion offering, collaborating with campaign star Sienna Miller for a summer collection and naming TV presenter Claudia Winkleman as its new brand ambassador for Jaeger for autumn/winter 24. It also introduced a repair service for the first time in collaboration with repair specialist Sojo.

Peter Ruis, executive director, John Lewis, and Jason Tarry, chair, John Lewis Partnership

John Lewis Partnership started the year with a new ""retail-focused"" leadership team, appointing fashion retail stalwart Peter Ruis as executive director of John Lewis in January and former Tesco CEO Jason Tarry as chairman of the partnership in April, replacing Sharon White.

Since taking up his new role at John Lewis, Ruis has focused on sharpening its fashion offering through investment in own and third-party brands and improving customer service by increasing staff members on the shop floor. He also brought back the retailer's ""Never knowingly undersold"" pledge in September, which was extended to price matching ecommerce platforms including Asos and Amazon.

Under Ruis and Tarry's stewardship, interesting partnerships are being unveiled such as a collaboration with designer label Awake Mode, which launched in October at 10 stores and online. In its Oxford Street flagship, a bigger beauty hall and a new Waterstones bookshop have landed, to be followed by a Jamie Oliver cookery school next spring.

Green shoots are beginning to appear: in September, when Tarry joined, the partnership posted a reduction in loss before tax and exceptional items to £5m for the 26 weeks to 27 July, compared with a loss of £57m in the previous year. The company said it is on target to ""significantly improve"" its performance for the full year.

As Ruis told Drapers Inner Circle Summit in October: ""I think we can double our fashion business. You don't grow unless you get out there and prove your relevance. We have a huge potential to grow over the course of the next decade.""

French businessman Régis Schultz took the reins of JD Sports Fashion from Peter Cowgill in August 2022 and has been driving a ""JD brand first"" growth strategy ever since.

The sportswear giant added 83 new JD Sports stores in the six months to 3 August, including the opening of its largest store at London's Westfield Stratford City in April. The store has achieved the highest turnover and footfall across its global portfolio and will be its ""blueprint for future openings"". The retailer is on track to open around 200 new JD stores globally in its 2024/25 financial year - a goal Schultz set out in February 2023 in a five-year plan to build the group into a ""leading global sports-fashion powerhouse"".

Under his leadership, the group, which owns JD Sports, Size?, Footpatrol and Go Outdoors, among other fascias, has forged ahead with its international expansion this year with the acquisition of US rival Hibbett. Following the $1.1bn (£878m) deal, the group's revenue in North America will account for 40% of total sales, up from 32%.

Group revenue during the six-month period rose 5.2% to £5.03bn and operating profit before adjusting items was up 6.7% to £451.1m. Schultz reassured investors in October that the business is on track to meet its annual profit target of between £955m to £1.04bn and shrugged off the falling demand facing Nike, its biggest supplier.

The group has continued to divest non-core assets and optimise its operations. It offloaded design and distribution agency Focus Brands for an undisclosed sum in January and closed its Derby distribution centre in September, affecting 200 jobs.

Next's Lord Wolfson upheld its mantra of ""under-promise and over-deliver"" this year as the highly respected retail leader steered the company towards £1bn profit for the first time.

In October, it raised its pre-tax profit guidance from£995m to £1.01bn for its 2024/25 financial year - an 9.5% increase on the previous year. Total group sales increased by 8% to £2.9bn for the six months to 27 July, while group profit before tax rose 7.1%, hitting £452m.

Wolfson said there is an opportunity to grow international sales, which accounted for £433m of full-price sales in the six-month period, up 22.8% year on year. The retailer is also growing its affordable luxury category to better serve the aspirational consumer. It launched a new ecommerce platform dedicated to premium brands called ""Seasons"" on 31 October, featuring Ganni, Joseph, Rixo and Veja, among others.

This year, Wolfson has slowed down the retailer's pace of acquisition after buying FatFace and Cath Kidston in 2023, and Joules and online furniture retailer Made.com in 2022. However, Next has not stopped investing in its brand portfolio: it bought a 16% stake in homeware and lifestyle brand Rockett St George for £0.8m, and invested £10m increasing its stake in Reiss from 72% to 74%.

Next has continued to be the partner of choice for other brands, thanks to its distribution infrastructure and product expertise. It has signed licence agreements with Barbour for suits, as well as with AllSaints and Superdry to launch their first childrenswear ranges in 2024."
Future of retail giant's Haverfordwest store remains unclear,Milford Mercury,https://www.milfordmercury.co.uk/news/24770819.future-homebase-haverfordwest-store-remains-unclear/,"The future of a retail giant's Pembrokeshire store remains uncertain, as administrators say they it is not currently provide information as to what will happen to it.

Homebase announced that it was going into administration last month. The DIY and gardening retailer has two stores in Wales, one of which is located at Haverfordwest's Wyndham Retail Park.

The joint administrators acting for Homebase, Gavin Park, Gavin Maher and Adele Macleod of Teneo Financial Advisory Limited, have completed a sale of up to 70 UK stores to IP to CDS (Superstores International) trading as The Range and Wilko, which is expected to secure up to 1,600 jobs.

Homebase stores will continue to trade until handed over to CDS. Homebase had recently completed on the sale of 11 UK stores to Sainsbury's and has exchanged on a further three.

The remaining 49 UK stores will continue to trade as normal while the joint administrators continue active discussions with interested parties.

It is, at present unclear where Haverfordwest's Homebase store fits into all this, with a spokesperson for Teneo unable to confirm if the Haverfordwest store would be closing and if so, when.

""We are not giving out any additional detail beyond what was in the original announcement,"" said the spokesperson. ""All stores are continuing to trade.""

A statement by Homebase said that the company had experienced a decline in sales over the last three years, resulting from worsening consumer confidence and available discretionary spend, which has coincided with a rise in input costs and supply chain disruption.

Homebase employs around 3,600 staff across its UK operations and there were not expected to be immediate redundancies while the administrators urgently assess the position of the companies.

All employee wages and benefits will be paid for their period of employment. Customer orders will still be fulfilled as far as possible and arrangements will be put in place to allow gift vouchers to be used.

""It has been an incredibly challenging three years for the home and garden improvement market,"" said Damian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase.

He said that the business had have taken many and wide-ranging actions to improve trading but these had not had the necessary effect.

He said that his priority continues to be the company's team members.

""I want to thank our team members and supplier partners from the bottom of my heart for their hard work and commitment over many years.""

Gavin Maher, Joint Administrator added: ""The sale to CDS preserves the Homebase brand and secures a significant number of jobs and we hope to complete sales of additional stores over the coming weeks.

""The remainder of the stores will continue to trade whilst buyers are sought. We thank Homebase's team members and other stakeholders for their continued support."""
"Apple Facing Hurdles in Adapting Baidu AI Models for China, The Information Reports",Asharq Al-Awsat English,https://english.aawsat.com/node/5088259,"The flag of China is placed next to the elements of Gallium and Germanium on a periodic table, in this illustration picture taken on July 6, 2023. (Reuters)

Beijing said Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organization or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales, without additional permission, to 140 companies including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier.

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.

The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ""abuses export control measures"" and has ""hindered normal economic and trade exchanges"".

- 'Weaponized' trade -

And on Tuesday, China said Washington had ""politicized and weaponized economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94 percent of the world's production of gallium -- used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels -- according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fiber optics and infrared, China makes up 83 percent of production.

Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use.

But the curbs unveiled Tuesday now ban them outright.

It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite --also key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, told AFP.

""It drives home an important point which is that China is not completely passive (and) there are some cards it can play and hit the US with as well with regards to chips,"" Loh added.

These ""back and forth curbs"" could create supply chain disruption, as well as inflationary pressures, should they affect trade for third parties, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science from the National University of Singapore.

But while the metals play critical roles in high-tech industries, they are upstream in the supply chain, which means their immediate impact on production ""is limited"", Brady Wang, associate director at technology market research firm Counterpoint, told AFP.

""As the US-China trade tensions have persisted for some time, many intermediary manufacturers in the supply chain have been stockpiling these materials,"" Wang added."
Govt asks fertilizer manufacturers to ensure healthy food for all,@businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/govt-asks-fertilizer-manufacturers-to-ensure-healthy-food-for-all/article68947176.ece,"The government on Wednesday said India faced challenges in the availability of chemical fertilizer di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) this year due to geopolitical disturbances, and asked stakeholders to continue working in cohesion in ensuring healthy food for all.

Addressing the annual seminar of the Fertilizer Association of India in New Delhi, Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Anupriya Patel praised her own department amid farmers reporting a huge shortage of DAP during key months of September-October when they need to prepare the field for next crop.

""Today, when I look at the scenario of the availability of fertilizers worldwide, I would like to say with pride that Department of Fertilizers has worked tirelessly to support the large farming community that we have in India,"" she said adding that the government took several proactive measures to overcome the challenge.

Geopolitical crisis

Further she said: ""We are all aware that India's agricultural sector depends significantly on the import of some of the critical fertilizers like DAP, MOP, NPKs and partially even urea. This year, there have been some geopolitical disturbances which led to supply chain disruption and that had an impact on the availability of fertilizers, especially of DAP in the country.""

The measures, taken by the government, included procurement of fertilizers through long-term agreements with supplier countries, focus on promoting the use of alternatives such as nano-fertilizers like nano-DAP and nano-Urea. Besides, the Department of Fertilizers had regular coordination with the States, port authorities, Ministry of Railways and fertilizer companies to ensure responsible dispatch of fertilizers to the demand-intensive regions.

The minister also touched upon the issue of soil health which resonates the government's focus on natural farming. She said: ""We must embrace a future where fertilizers are used religiously and where agricultural productivity is enhanced without compromising the health of the soil and environment. ""

""Through this platform, I would like to request all the stakeholders in this sector to continue working in cohesion in the interest of our larger goal, which is to ensure healthy food for all,"" she said.

Govt's special package

When asked if the current DAP shortage would lead to drop in yield of rabi crops, she declined to comment.

Data show that the opening balance in current rabi season was 17.75 lakh tonne (lt) against 25.41 lt year-ago. Sales of DAP were recorded at 11.48 lt in October 2024, which is 16 per cent lower than 13.64 lt year-ago. The estimated demand for October was pegged at 18.69 lt by States. However, in the first week of November, sales of DAP rebounded to 3.20 lt from 2.62 lt year-ago.

The import of DAP surged 58.6 per cent to 8.17 lt in October from 5.15 lt in the corresponding period last year. But during April-October period its import dropped 29 per cent to 27.84 lt.

The minister also said the government has announced a special package of ₹2,625 crore in which ₹3,500 per tonne additional subsidy has been fixed to make the price sustainable for the companies to import DAP and remains unaffected by the global price volatility. Secondly, the overall increase in the prices of phosphatic (P) and potash (K) fertilizers in the international market has to be related to the domestic market prices.

Appealing to global suppliers attending the event, she urged them to contribute to the bigger objective of making sufficient fertilizers available to Indian farmers and assured them that it is going to be a win-win situation not just for them, but also for the farmers. Patel said the government wants to ensure sufficient quantity of fertilizer is made available at the right time and at reasonable prices to farmers.

Patel said the government took two major decisions to address the challenges for the current Rabi (winter-sown) season, 2024-25.

The first decision is regarding offering of a special package of Rs 3,500 per tonne on DAP, costing Rs 2,625 crore to the central exchequer, which is to make the price sustainable for the companies to import DAP amid global price volatility, the minister said.

Secondly, Patel said that the overall increase in the prices of P&K fertilisers in the international market has been linked to the market prices. ""If the procurement price of P&K fertilisers including DAP increases in the global market, the procurement capacities of the companies are not going to be affected,"" she added.

In 2024-25, the government has approved one-time special package on DAP beyond the NBS rates on actual PoS (Point of Sale) sale of DAP for the period from April 1, 2024 till December 31, 2024 at the rate of Rs 3,500 per tonne to the P&K fertilizer companies with approximate financial implication of Rs 2,625 crore to ensure sustainable availability of DAP at affordable prices to the farmers.

On November 27, the ministry had said in a statement, ""This year, due to the prevailing geo-political situations such as less export to India by major suppliers and the Red Sea Crisis, the DAP supplies were affected."" India is dependent upon the DAP imports to meet domestic demand. At present, about 60 per cent of the DAP requirement is met through imports. As per the industry estimates, the country requires 10 million tonnes of DAP annually.

In his video message, Union Chemicals & Fertilizers Minister J P Nadda said, ""Our reliance on imports for phosphate and potassic fertilizers, coupled with global price volatility, necessitates bold steps towards self reliance."" Nadda highlighted that the government has undertaken significant measures such as revival of urea plants and promoting neem and sulphur coated urea and nano fertilizers to enhance the efficiency.

He said there is a need to give a strong focus on enhancing fertilizer efficiency.

Persistent tracking is vital to safeguard shipping in dark seas,LNG Industry,https://www.lngindustry.com/special-reports/04122024/persistent-tracking-is-vital-to-safeguard-shipping-in-dark-seas/,"The ever-worsening geopolitical situation is creating unprecedented challenges for the shipping sector and wider supply chain. An expanding shadow fleet, openly undertaking illegal ship-to-ship (STS) transfers of Russian oil and LNG, has compounded the longer-standing dark shipping problem that has emerged as a result of illegal activity (people, arms, drugs, contraband, and fish smuggling), which not only threatens national security, but also the safety of vessels and heightens concerns regarding environmental disaster and supply chain disruption.

In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) issued an Assembly Resolution A.1192(33) in December 2023 urging governments and all related stakeholders to undertake measures to address the shadow fleet. While stakehold-ers are still predominantly reliant upon automatic identification system (AIS) ves-sel tracking, however, the dark ship problem will continue. It is it simply too easy for bad actors to turn off, jam, or spoof AIS tracking.

Enhanced fleet tracking is now a priority that can only be achieved if stake-holders can evolve beyond the simplicity of AIS to a multi-layered tracking model that leverages diverse data sources and real-time analytics to provide the next generation of accurate, trusted vessel positioning.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the global maritime order on which all countries depend to protect global shipping and supply chains, is under untenable strain. The escalating geopolitical uncertainty across the Black Sea/Crimea, South China Sea/Spratly Islands, Red Sea-Gulf of Aden/Yemen, along with the Straits of Hormuz/Iran is seriously undermining this order. Indeed, the rise in attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden is causing ship masters themselves to switch off AIS tracking in a bid to avoid being targeted. While this may remove immediate vulnerability to this threat, ships operating without AIS significantly raise the risk of collision, with associated potential loss of life and environmental damage, as well as creating supply chain uncertainty.

The lack of transparency in shipping is now of a global concern to those governments and stakeholders that wish to operate in compliance, creating a world of good actors and bad actors. The shift by Russian oil tankers away from the large open registries to smaller, less diligent flags in response to heightened sanctions from the US, EU, the UK, and others, further underlines the complexities facing the IMO and national regulatory bodies attempting to reinstate order.

Fast on the heels of the IMO Assembly Resolution, the US issued a Quint Seal Notice from its key regulators later in December 2023 calling on all stakeholders, including vessel owners, charterers, exporters, brokers, shipping companies, freight forwarders, commodities traders, and financial institutions, to assess their risk profiles and implement risk-based compliance programs.

Whilst the need to improve shipping transparency is a given, solving it is far from straightforward. It is generally outside the capability of a single organisation for reasons of specialisation; involving data selection, aggregation, management/storage, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) processing, and overall technical complexity and cost - thus it is best to align with an established specialist application service provider.

The regulatory demand for stakeholders to strengthen and utilise enhanced fleet tracking demonstrates concern over the current limitations of tracking solutions. The ease with which illicit shipping can affect AIS tracking, through switching-off, spoofing, and jamming, confirms that this ubiquitous system is not reliable enough to provide the tracking rigour required for today's maritime security, safety, environmental, and sanctions compliance needs. Continued reliance on AIS alone will compromise attempts at compliance enforcement. The industry now urgently requires a more robust solution that leverages multiple tracking data sources supplemented at times with affordable earth-observation (EO) data sources to deliver persistent tracking of every vessel without compromise.

The call for an enhanced compliance focus has highlighted to stakeholders the inherent risks associated with relying solely on AIS tracking. Stakeholders require a far more reliable tracking solution that overcomes AIS vulnerabilities, not only in high-risk areas (HRAs) but also in known jamming areas, ports, and high-ship density areas subject to signal contention where tracking information can sometimes be hard to attain or is disrupted.

Persistent tracking overlays multiple vessel tracking services and data sources, including AIS and secure point-to-point satellite tracking systems (Inmarat-C, Iridium, etc.), voyage plans when available, EO-data when relevant, and uses real-time analytics to transform the accuracy and reliability and vessel location data.

With multiple, layered data sources and robust cross referencing and analysis, the persistent tracking model allows stakeholders to have increased confidence in the true vessel position. Guessing is eliminated and errors associated with false positives are minimised, allowing stakeholders to ensure any anomaly or vessel deviation is immediately identified and notified, and open to investigation.

Multiple, diverse vessel detection technologies feed into live dashboards, providing stakeholders with the essential visibility and control required to confidently locate and manage vessels. By adding the power of predictive analytics, AI and ML, stakeholders can gain far more insight into the extent of dark activity and ensure secure, safe, clean, and compliant operations.

The simplicity of AIS has transformed the accessibility of vessel tracking over the past few decades. But in today's overcrowded and high-risk seas, that simplicity is now a liability. It is too easy to disable, jam, or spoof AIS signals, creating inconsistencies in vessel track data that allow bad actors to operate unchallenged while genuine vessels' safety is also compromised. Add in signal blockages caused by the congestion of positions being transmitted and stakeholders increasingly recognise that the gaps appearing in tracking systems globally are creating untenable risk.

From compromised security and loss of life to environmental disaster, supply chain disruption to escalating insurance costs, the lack of visibility across seas globally must be urgently addressed. Proposing additional sanctions and greater risk assessment is a necessary start, but without a persistent tracking solution that can layer multiple tracking data streams to overcome the current information gaps, the maritime industry will continue to incur unacceptable risk.

Future of retail giant's Haverfordwest store remains unclear,Western Telegraph,https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/24770819.future-homebase-haverfordwest-store-remains-unclear/,"The future of a retail giant's Pembrokeshire store remains uncertain, as administrators say they it is not currently provide information as to what will happen to it.

Homebase announced that it was going into administration last month. The DIY and gardening retailer has two stores in Wales, one of which is located at Haverfordwest's Wyndham Retail Park.

The joint administrators acting for Homebase, Gavin Park, Gavin Maher and Adele Macleod of Teneo Financial Advisory Limited, have completed a sale of up to 70 UK stores to IP to CDS (Superstores International) trading as The Range and Wilko, which is expected to secure up to 1,600 jobs.

Homebase stores will continue to trade until handed over to CDS. Homebase had recently completed on the sale of 11 UK stores to Sainsbury's and has exchanged on a further three.

The remaining 49 UK stores will continue to trade as normal while the joint administrators continue active discussions with interested parties.

It is, at present unclear where Haverfordwest's Homebase store fits into all this, with a spokesperson for Teneo unable to confirm if the Haverfordwest store would be closing and if so, when.

""We are not giving out any additional detail beyond what was in the original announcement,"" said the spokesperson. ""All stores are continuing to trade.""

A statement by Homebase said that the company had experienced a decline in sales over the last three years, resulting from worsening consumer confidence and available discretionary spend, which has coincided with a rise in input costs and supply chain disruption.

Homebase employs around 3,600 staff across its UK operations and there were not expected to be immediate redundancies while the administrators urgently assess the position of the companies.

All employee wages and benefits will be paid for their period of employment. Customer orders will still be fulfilled as far as possible and arrangements will be put in place to allow gift vouchers to be used.

""It has been an incredibly challenging three years for the home and garden improvement market,"" said Damian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase.

He said that the business had have taken many and wide-ranging actions to improve trading but these had not had the necessary effect.

He said that his priority continues to be the company's team members.

""I want to thank our team members and supplier partners from the bottom of my heart for their hard work and commitment over many years.""

Gavin Maher, Joint Administrator added: ""The sale to CDS preserves the Homebase brand and secures a significant number of jobs and we hope to complete sales of additional stores over the coming weeks.

""The remainder of the stores will continue to trade whilst buyers are sought. We thank Homebase's team members and other stakeholders for their continued support."""
China curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US,New Era Live,https://neweralive.na/china-curbs-exports-of-key-chipmaking-components-to-us/,"BEIJING - Beijing yesterday said it will restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.

The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ""abuses export control measures"" and has ""hindered normal economic and trade exchanges"".

Yesterday, China said Washington had ""politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94% of the world's production of gallium - used in integrated circuits, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic panels - according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83% of production.

Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end-use.

But the curbs unveiled yesterday now ban them outright.

It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite -also key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told AFP.

""Should these back-and-forth curbs affect trade for third parties, this can create some trade and supply chain disruption as well as associated inflationary pressures,"" he said."

-'Be cautious' -

Multiple Chinese trade associations released similarly worded statements Tuesday urging members to seek local alternatives to US chips.

The Internet Society of China called on companies to ""be cautious when procuring US chips, seek to expand cooperation with chip companies in other countries and regions, and actively use chips produced and manufactured in China by domestic and foreign enterprises"".

China bans exports of key microchip elements to US as trade tensions escalate,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/04/us-china-microchips-export-bans-gallium-germanium,"Semiconductor restrictions on China announced by Washington a day earlier prompt retaliation involving critical minerals including gallium and germanium

The Chinese government has said it will ban exports to the US of some key components in making semiconductors, escalating trade tensions a day after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export were the metals gallium, antimony and germanium, China's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another component in semiconductors, would be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said. The curbs strengthen enforcement of existing limits on critical minerals exports that Beijing began rolling out last year, but apply only to the US market.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" the ministry said.

Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells. Antimony is used in bullets and other weaponry, while graphite is the largest component by volume of electric vehicle batteries.

There is concern that Beijing could next target other critical minerals, including those with even broader usage such as nickel and cobalt.

China accounts for 94% of the world's production of gallium, and 83% of germanium.

Chinese customs data shows there were no shipments of wrought and unwrought germanium or gallium to the US this year through October, when a year earlier it was the fourth and fifth-largest market for the minerals.

Similarly, China's overall October shipments of antimony products plunged by 97% from September after Beijing's move to limit its exports took effect.

China curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US,Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-curbs-exports-key-chipmaking-092032555.html,"Beijing said Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

Washington announced Monday restrictions on sales to 140 companies including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, expanding efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China. These can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

On Tuesday, China added that the United States had ""politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94 percent of the world's production of gallium -- used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels -- according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83 percent of production.

Beijing last year already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use.

But Tuesday's rules now ban them outright.

It also previously restricted exports of certain types of graphite -- key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, told AFP.

""It drives home an important point which is that China is not completely passive (and) there are some cards it can play and hit the US with as well with regards to chips,"" Loh added.

These ""back and forth curbs"" could create supply chain disruption, as well as inflationary pressures, should they affect trade for third parties, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science from the National University of Singapore.

While the metals play critical roles in high-tech industries, they are upstream in the supply chain, meaning the immediate impact on production ""is limited"", Brady Wang, associate director at technology market research firm Counterpoint, told AFP.

""As the US-China trade tensions have persisted for some time, many intermediary manufacturers in the supply chain have been stockpiling these materials,"" Wang added.

-'Be cautious' -

Multiple Chinese trade associations released similarly worded statements Tuesday urging members to seek local alternatives to US chips.

The Internet Society of China called on companies to ""be cautious when procuring US chips, seek to expand cooperation with chip companies in other countries and regions, and actively use chips produced and manufactured in China by domestic and foreign enterprises"".

Impact of Escalating Geopolitical Tensions on United States Sex Toys Market

Escalating geopolitical tensions could significantly impact the growth of United States Sex Toys Market. For example, supply chain disruption is spurred by geopolitical tensions because of trade restrictions and tariffs imposed by United States. Sex toys are heavily imported into the nation from foreign nations, mostly China. Trade restrictions cause product shortages, which raise costs of sex toys. The geopolitical tensions-induced economic instability could also lead buyers to place a higher value on necessities than luxuries, such as sex toys. Trade disputes and tensions, nevertheless, may benefit homegrown businesses and draw attention to the country's sex toys industry.

China curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US,WFXG FOX54,https://www.wfxg.com/news/china-curbs-exports-of-key-chipmaking-components-to-us/article_3a01f2ad-5a54-5354-9d52-4edcbd4bc699.html,"Beijing said Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.

The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ""abuses export control measures"" and has ""hindered normal economic and trade exchanges"".

- 'Weaponised' trade -

And on Tuesday, China said Washington had ""politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94 percent of the world's production of gallium -- used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels -- according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83 percent of production.

Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use.

But the curbs unveiled Tuesday now ban them outright.

It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite --also key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University told AFP.

""Should these back and forth curbs affect trade for third parties, this can create some trade and supply chain disruption -- as well as associated inflationary pressures,"" said Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore.

""It drives home an important point which is that China is not completely passive (and) there are some cards it can play and hit the US with as well with regards to chips,"" Loh added.

These ""back and forth curbs"" could create supply chain disruption, as well as inflationary pressures, should they affect trade for third parties, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science from the National University of Singapore.

But while the metals play critical roles in high-tech industries, they are upstream in the supply chain, which means their immediate impact on production ""is limited"", Brady Wang, associate director at technology market research firm Counterpoint, told AFP.

""As the US-China trade tensions have persisted for some time, many intermediary manufacturers in the supply chain have been stockpiling these materials,"" Wang added."

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.

The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ""abuses export control measures"" and has ""hindered normal economic and trade exchanges"".

- 'Weaponised' trade -

And on Tuesday, China said Washington had ""politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94 percent of the world's production of gallium -- used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels -- according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83 percent of production.

Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use.

But the curbs unveiled Tuesday now ban them outright.

It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite --also key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told AFP.

""Should these back and forth curbs affect trade for third parties, this can create some trade and supply chain disruption -- as well as associated inflationary pressures,"" he said.

Executives have emissions target tunnel vision,sustainableviews.com,https://www.sustainableviews.com/executives-have-emissions-target-tunnel-vision-ab56d8b2/,"Scott Lane is chief executive and founder of sustainability management platform Speeki

Corporate environmental, social and governance is caught between a rock and a hard place. ESG initiatives are under full broadside in the current political climate, which looks unrecognisable from the social justice zenith of 2021, leading to widescale rollbacks of sustainable and social commitments as boards fear public backlash.

Alongside this cultural and political shift, companies have also found themselves caught in the pincer of cold, hard economic reality -- inflation, although tamed, has hurt bottom lines and high interest rates look set to stay.

In this frugal era of corporate cost-cutting, to hammer-armed executives looking to smash any unnecessary expenditure, ESG and sustainability increasingly look like a nail.

Yet despite these forces, ESG and sustainability have been so thoroughly baked in to corporate culture over the past few years, they will never be fully eradicated. A generation of MBAs and business graduates have come of age, with ESG as a core pillar of corporate leadership, and the consumers that are not calling for ESG's destruction want to see it retained and extended.

Executives, pulled in two competing directions, end up doing this strange half dance, extolling their ESG credentials with grand, sweeping commitments to future targets in one move, and cutting back on social and sustainability initiatives with the other.

COP, which recently held its 29th instalment in Baku, Azerbaijan, is symbolic of this devotion to emissions targets. Each year, businesses and corporate leaders flock to the conference, to hear commitments to a constantly changing range of numbers.

COP has good intentions, but its myopic tunnel vision on emissions targets, precludes alternative thinking and suggestions, and it sets the tone for sustainability discussions globally, whether it is politicians who build on discussions with their own pledges, as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer did doubling down on an 81 per cent emissions cut by 2035, or corporate leaders who bring targets back to their boards.

Instead of this endless stream of targets, I believe there is another way -- executives must rediscover ESG realism. These grand pledges to hit emissions targets in the future inevitably lead to broken promises, wasted expenditure and trust. They only serve to fuel the fire of anti-ESG forces.

Instead, it is time to scrap corporate emissions targets. Executives must start to meet ESG where it is at now, rather than trying to drag it into a distant future. And the way for corporate leaders to chart a course through today's choppy ESG waters is to focus on the tangible, practical and value-adding gains that can be made now, rather than committing themselves to lofty, and often arbitrary, commitments in the future.

""Sustainability"" is an enormously complex consideration that feeds into every process in a company, across all departments and up and down the supply chain. By reducing this complexity down to a single number, companies are blinding themselves to other areas where they can genuinely make an impact.

Companies do not only interact with their environment through carbon emissions, and there are a host of areas where they could make a tangible impact right now. Water consumption, land use and waste generation are areas that fly under the radar in corporate sustainability and which executives have ignored to their detriment.

Implementing water recycling systems or reducing water usage can quickly enhance a corporation's ESG and sustainability credentials in a matter of weeks, rather than the years and even decades in which carbon emissions targets are measured.

Not only does it generate quick and tangible sustainability gains that executives can point to, but there are also very real cost efficiencies to present to shareholders as well.

Water recycling systems will lower utility bills and make companies less exposed to external supply shocks. Diverting organic waste to anaerobic digesters can cut down on electricity costs. Again, in the context of external geopolitical and supply chain disruption, the benefits afforded by resilience will build exponentially on top of immediate cost savings.

Many corporations have recognised the potential of these areas, and have sought to combine them with the conventional ""big vision"" emissions targets. The problem, though, is that emissions targets act like a vortex, sucking in the resource and attention from these other, less media-friendly measures, detracting from ESG progress in total. It is not a zero-sum game, but equally, executives have to break out from the emissions target tunnel vision.

Far too many executives have missed the genuinely sustainable gains right under their noses. They might not generate as many headlines or placate social media activists, but when taken together they would do far more to bolster a corporation's ESG credentials, build consumer trust and reduce costs, rather than chasing their tails with impossible targets."
The wrong kind of inheritance: how to replace legacy technology in government - Global Government Forum,Global Gov Forum,https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/the-wrong-kind-of-inheritance-how-to-replace-legacy-technology-in-government/,"""Technology modernisation is not a destination; it's an ongoing journey,"" said Laura Gerhardt, director of technology modernization and data in the US Office of Management and Budget. Addressing 40 senior digital leaders from US departments and overseas governments at GovernmentDX in Washington DC, Gerhardt was tackling one of the thorniest topics in public sector IT in a session entitled: 'The barriers to overhauling legacy technology in government - and how they can be overcome'.

Global Government Forum's public service digital conference GovernmentDX - now renamed Government Service Delivery, and scheduled for 13-14 May 2025 - includes a series of private roundtables for top digital leaders, providing a safe space for candid discussions on the challenges they face and the routes to success. Speaking at the inaugural event in the session on legacy, participants were particularly candid: replacing an old system is often far more difficult than creating a brand new service, and the cumbersome, static systems built by previous generations of IT leaders have proved an awkward inheritance for today's digital chiefs.

As one participant commented: ""Technology is never finished - there are always going to be emerging threats, new customer requirements, new capabilities that need to be integrated into existing solutions."" But this simple truth has not always been recognised.

""When we built those applications, we really did think that we were building them once and they were going to run forever,"" commented Greg Gershman, co-founder and CEO of digital services provider Ad Hoc (pictured speaking). In time, however, circumstances changed - and inflexible, monolithic IT systems proved unable to adapt to public servants' evolving needs.

Another senior digital leader related a ""horror story"" neatly illustrating the flaws in how IT professionals used to build technology systems. Twenty years ago, he recalled, one major government agency commissioned a consultancy to write ""the mother of all requirements documents"", then contracted a big IT firm to construct its new system. ""The cost to build the thing went from 200 million up to nearly 900 million, and it took nearly seven years,"" he explained - but when they revealed it to frontline staff, the response was that it didn't meet the way they worked at all. As a result, he explained, ""staff reverted to paper and spreadsheets, and they hired a bunch of people to key those spreadsheets into the system every evening. Not only did they waste a billion dollars, but they also created a massive workflow bottleneck.""

Such projects have lumbered today's technologists with IT systems that are increasingly unable to handle the challenges facing them - from cyber threats and meeting the accessibility requirements of an ageing population to sudden spikes in demand. Tim Paydos, vice president for global public sector mission solutions at event knowledge partner ServiceNow (left), gave one example of the consequences: ""During the early days of COVID, one US state saw a 950% increase in calls to their unemployment agency in one week, and the system crashed,"" he recalled. ""The call centre could not intake requests for financial relief fast enough, and the back-end 'cheque-cutting' system did not have the agility to meet this new demand.""

""We don't know what the next big thing is going to be, but there's a sense of foreboding that these 'black swan' events are happening more often and having greater impact - whether it's supply chain disruption, cyber attacks, regional conflicts, climate events, pandemics,"" he said. ""Whatever it is, the government needs the agility and flexibility to react with speed and restore citizens' trust.""

Government Service Delivery is the new name for GovernmentDX and will be taking place in the Walter E Washington Convention Center, Washington DC on May 13-14, 2025. Find out more about the event and register your interest here.

Against this backdrop, there is a push to replace ageing mainframes with adaptable, cloud-based digital services - transforming services along the way to realise the full potential of today's technologies. As an example of what is possible, Paydos cited one large Californian county where public servants built a new platform for 11 public agencies working on issues related to homelessness.

Previously, homeless people had to interact with up to 11 different professionals - but with the new system in place, staff from any one of those agencies could help them to access services from all 11. ""It was a force multiplier,"" commented Paydos. ""Within six months, they had dropped homelessness by 30%, and the folks leaving temporary housing to go back to the streets dropped by 80%.""

To build trust in the new system, Paydos explained, agencies were allowed to retain control of their own data - feeding information to individual caseworkers as required - and app developers demonstrated value quickly with a basic service that people immediately found helpful. ""It took 12 weeks from the initial workshop to having something on an iPad for people to use in the field,"" he said. ""It began to work - and as it began to work, people began to believe and started building trust. Then they started to expand the use cases.""

There are always challenges to overcome when overhauling service provision in this way - often including public sector procurement and finance processes. ""Your governance assumes that you're building a submarine, not software, so it expects you to have absolute certainty at the point of least knowledge: at the beginning of the programme,"" commented one digital leader. ""And if you do get the funding, it's a large capital investment on the assumption that once you've built the thing, you'll never need to support it afterwards.""

Legislation can also get in the way, noted another digital chief - tightly defining processes in ways that constrain how services can be delivered. Ironically, the sheer amount of work involved in maintaining legacy systems can also limit the time and resources available to devise a better solution. ""It eats up all your discretionary time and your people,"" said one participant. ""We have amazing people in our agencies who are spending 80% of their time feeding and watering these awful monolithic systems rather than doing the transformation.""

The need to pare down the accumulated legislation that holds back transformation was also flagged as a key recommendation in Global Government Forum's From Lagging to Leading: The Opportunity for a Breakthrough in U.S. Government Digital Service Delivery study, based on interviews with 13 members of the US federal government's CIO Council. Read the report in full here.

Nonetheless, leaders attending GovernmentDX had found ways to replace these outdated systems with modern digital services. One representative championed the ""strangler fig"" approach advocated by digital expert Martin Fowler. This involves incrementally building up new data feeds and services around the legacy system, until eventually it has been rendered redundant and can be retired.

""You don't try to change the monolith: you build an API, and that allows you to build microservices to replace individual components,"" they said. In the case of one ageing legacy system, they recalled, managers had recruited frontline staff ""and taught them how to be product managers, then we got them to prioritise. The [legacy] system did 70 or 80 different things, so we picked four or five of them, and with agile teams we built modern microservices; in the background, we switched off those bits"".

As a result the legacy system was slowly eclipsed, while frontline staff ""were getting these amazing digital services designed around how they worked, and they didn't have to interact with the back-end system any more"".

While the previous generation of IT professionals planned 'big bang' solutions, then built systems that were out of date before they were up and running, today's digital leaders feel their way forward is to build solutions flexible enough to adapt to changing needs. ""That's our playbook,"" the digital leader advised. ""Iterate your way out of the problem.""

This incremental approach has the advantage of building people's confidence gradually through demonstrable results. ""Get enough funding for a small team, build something of value, and then show it to the people who control the money,"" they concluded. That fitted with Paydos's approach. ""Find five or ten use cases: lightweight, low trauma solutions to specific pain points,"" he said. ""Get them delivered, get value, build skills and competence, build trust in your organisation. Then go to the next use case. While what we're talking about is transformational and revolutionary, the path to value is very much iterative and evolutionary.""

As the discussion came to a close, Lauren Bracey Scheidt, assistant commissioner of the Technology Transformation Services Office of Solutions in the US General Services Administration, (pictured centre with Scott Jones, president, Shared Services Canada, left, and Larry Bafundo, deputy executive director and acting executive director, Technology Modernization Fund, US General Services Administration, right) neatly summarised the challenge facing governments around the world. ""What we do in a crisis is what we do all the time, just louder and with more urgency,"" she said. ""So if the processes and structures that we build while things are calm and safe can only move slowly, that's what we'll do in a crisis - and we won't get the outcomes we need.""

China curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US,RTL Today,https://today.rtl.lu/news/business-and-tech/a/2256079.html,"Beijing said Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.

Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ""national security"" concerns.

Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ""stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses"", the ministry said.

""To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,"" Beijing said.

""Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,"" it added.

In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.

The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.

The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ""abuses export control measures"" and has ""hindered normal economic and trade exchanges"".

- 'Weaponised' trade -

And on Tuesday, China said Washington had ""politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues"" as it unveiled its own export curbs.

The moves also restrict the exports of ""dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes"", Beijing said.

China accounts for 94 percent of the world's production of gallium -- used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels -- according to a report by the European Union published this year.

For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83 percent of production.

Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use.

But the curbs unveiled Tuesday now ban them outright.

It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite --also key to making batteries for electric vehicles.

""The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,"" Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told AFP.

""Should these back and forth curbs affect trade for third parties, this can create some trade and supply chain disruption -- as well as associated inflationary pressures,"" he said."
